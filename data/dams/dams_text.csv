dam_20,Agate Dam,"Agate Dam is a zoned earthfill embankment about 13 miles northeast of Medford, Oregon, on Dry Creek. The structure has a height of 86 feet and a crest length of 3,800 feet and contains 421,000 cubic yards of material. The reservoir behind the dam has a total capacity of 4,800 acre-feet (active 4,780 acre-feet). Geology Agate Dam is in a narrow valley with steep slide slopes. The left abutment juts out into the valley and at a height of 50 feet above the stream flattens off into a bench. Ice or glacial deposits, causing ice or glacial melt water to discharge, once blocked the stream channel over a bench a few hundred feet behind the left abutment. A channel developed which extends from this rock bench to a point in the present channel a few hundred feet downstream from the dam site. Bedrock at the lowest point of the old channel is about 15 feet above the reservoir flow line. Overburden at the flow line on the right abutment consisted of 28 feet of gravel with excess sand and silt. Boulders were hard, fresh andesite 2 to 3 feet in diameter. Much of the over burden between flow line and the valley flow was undoubtedly quite permeable.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=20

dam_24,American Falls Dam,"American Falls Dam is a 94-foot-high composite concrete and earth structure on the Snake River near American Falls, Idaho. Project storage was increased by 1,700,000 acre-feet in 1927 with the completion of the dam. A core-drilling program in the early 1960s revealed that the concrete in portions of the dam was in a relatively advanced stage of deterioration due to a chemical reaction between alkalis in the cement and the aggregate. This type of reaction, unknown at the time of construction, resulted in a significant loss in strength and durability, threatening the competence of the dam. In the early 1970s, storage was limited to 11.3 feet below full pool, which reduced the reservoir storage capacity to 1,125,000 acre-feet, about 66 percent of maximum design capacity. By congressional act of December 28, 1973, the American Falls Reservoir District, acting as the constructing agency representing the storage spaceholders, was authorized to finance and contract for the replacement of American Falls Dam. The new dam, completed in 1978, replaced the concrete portion of the original structure and was built immediately downstream from the old dam. During reconstruction, the reservoir area was surveyed and the total storage capacity is now 1,672,600 acre-feet (active 1,672,600 acre-feet). After Congress passed the 1978 Safety of Dams Act, the American Falls Reservoir District was repaid for their construction costs.

It has a total storage capacity of474,900 acre-feet (active413,100 acre-feet) and was the world's highest earthfill dam at the time of its completion in 1950. The power plant had a rated capacity of 27,000 kilowatts with two units installed. These units were up-rated in 1986, increasing the capacity to 20,000 kilowatts each for a total of 40,000 kilowatts. Geology Anderson Ranch Dam is located near the southwestern edge of Idaho Batholith which is composed of a series of closely related, coarse-grained intrusions. Major normal faulting in the region includes faults in and adjacent to the Batholith, faults bounding the northeast and southwest margin on the adjacent Snake River Plain, and faults forming Camas Prairie Basin east of the dam. These faults show a low to moderate seismic activity level. The dam is located in a narrow steep-sided valley cut through several hundred of igneous extrusive and extrusive rock. In the dam foundation, the rock was found to be intensely fractured and cut by numerous shears and fractures of varying widths. Several dikes were also found normal to the canyon axis. The dikes present a reduction of fractures and shears reducing the foundation permeability and making a tight foundation. Materials within the canyon include talus, colluvium, alluvium, residual soil and intact rock. These materials form the foundation of the dam and have performed well with respect to deformation and seepage.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=259

The Monroe Creek is underlain by the Gering, Brule, Chadron and Pierre Formations, which range from Miocene to Upper Cretaceous in age. Windblown silt and fine sand mantle the surface in the reservoir area. The Niobrara River incised a broad channel approximately 1,400 feet wide along the bottom of the valley. The channel was located near the left side of the valley at the time of construction. The left abutment and spillway are founded on weathered siltstone bedrock and alluvial deposits. The dam foundation to the right of station 19+30 is founded on surficial eolian and alluvial materials. The bedrock at the site is described as a tan to light brown, sandy siltstone containing numerous limy concretions, volcanic ash and bone fossils. Lenses of sandstone and conglomerate also occur. The beds are primarily cemented with calcium carbonate varying from weakly to non-cemented. Weathering of the siltstone decomposes to a soil-like sandy silt (ML) material. Bedding is nearly horizontal and usually massive. The Niobrara River Fault was mapped along the length of the river valley at the site of Box Butte Dam. The fault zone forms a graben along which the river traverses. The Nebraska Geological Survey indicated the last movement along the Niobrara River Fault occurred approximately 16 million years ago. Drilling for the CAS in 1988 along the left abutment and spillway encountered soil materials ranging from 1.1 to 15.0 ft. in thickness. The soil appears to be derived from the underlying siltstone of the Monroe Creek Formation. Dry density samples were tested and ranged from 63.48 to 103.45 pcf, averaging 84.95 pcf. The bedrock underlying the eolian deposits was described as uncemented to weakly cemented, soft siltstone. Thin discontinuous lenses of weakly to moderately cemented sandstone and fine conglomerate with light colored volcanic ash and a few scattered limy concretions were also encountered. The cutoff trench encountered siltstone and sandstone at approximate elevation 3942 between the service spillway and station 19+50. The remainder of the embankment material lies on alluvial material composed of silty sand with gravel up to 40 feet in thickness. The eolian and alluvial materials are considered to be liquefiable under seismic loading.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=67

dam_31,Buckhorn Dam,"Most of the Grass Valley Creek drainage basin is located within the Shasta Balley Batholith. This Jurassic batholith ranges in composition from a quartz diorite to granodiorite and is deeply weathered. Cenozoic alluvial deposits accumulated over much of the area. Remnants of terrace deposits are scattered on hillsides above the present-day creekbed. Quaternary alluvial deposits are deposited within the tributary drainages and creekbed; a variable depths of slopewash cover most of the slopes. At the damsite, Grass Valley Creek meanders across on alluvium-filled flood plain which is mapped as Qal and varies from 240 to 460 feet wide and consists mostly of loose to firm silty sand and poorly graded sand with silt. On the hillsides, quartz diorite, mapped as Jqd, is usually covered by slopewash, mapped as Qsw. The slopewash consists mostly silty sand. Remnants of terrace deposits, mapped as QTt, are scattered on hillsides above the present-day creek bed and consist of mostly silty sand, poorly graded to silty sand and sandy lean clay. outcrops of quartz diorite and core is differentiate on the basis of weathering which ranges from decomposed to slightly weathered. The water table slopes toward Grass Valley Creek from the adjacent quartz diorite ridge. Active springs, seeps and a swamp area are confined to the channel area. Water level readings in the abutments indicates water levels rises within the abutments to elevation 2770.0 feet in left abutment drill hole LA-1 and to elevation 2780 in auger hole AP-411 in the right abutment.

dam_36,Bull Lake Dam,"Bull Lake Reservoir is located on Bull Lake Creek about 40 miles northwest of Riverton, Wyoming. It lies in a glaciated valley that formerly held a smaller natural lake. The dam and reservoir overlie a series of morainal and lacustrine deposits. Surrounding valley walls are covered with a veneer of glacial debris overlying rocks ranging in age from Mississippian near the mountain front to Tertiary near the dam. Landslides have developed an the slopes in both the glacial deposits and in the underlying bedrock. Near the left abutment of the dam boulders from a Pleistocene till deposit occasionally fall into the parking area. They are more of a nuisance than a hazard. Along the south side of the reservoir near the dam wave cut banks that continually ravel material into the reservoir have formed in a similar till deposit. No significant changes from previous visits were noted at either site. A large slide which involves bedrock is located on the south valley wall about four miles upstream from the dam. It consists of a series of interconnecting rotational slumps that include the Frontier and Cody Formations of Cretaceous age. These formations are composed of dark gray to black, incompetent marine shales that dip 10 to 15 degrees to the northeast. The direction of movement of the slide is to the northwest, or normal to bedding dip. The unstable area occurs on a 5-to-I slope, is 2,500 feet wide, 3,000 feet long, and probably exceeds 20 feet in thickness. Volume of the mass is probably greater than 5 million cubic yards. Similar landslides occur around other Bureau impoundments in Wyoming and Montana. Documented movement of the slide masses is limited to intermittent creep that is usually activated.by increasing moisture conditions or lowering reservoir water levels. Rapid movement of the slides has not been recorded at any of the sites.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=36
dam_37,Bully Creek Dam,"Bully Creek Dam is located on Bully Creek about 8 miles northwest of the creek's confluence with the Malheur River, and 9 miles northwest of Vale, Oregon.

Geology Bully Creek Dam is located in the western part of Snake River Plain Physiographic Province. The plain is an arcuate depression that extends from eastern Oregon across southern Idaho and into western Wyoming. It contains great amounts of late Cenozoic silicic and basaltic volcanic products and interbedded late Cenozoic sediments. The region is highly dissected by streams owing to its relatively weak bedrock surface. Locally, rocks outcropping in the area are generally Miocene and younger in age. They include volcanics, graben deposits, western Snake River Plain deposits of the Idaho Group, and Quanternary deposits.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=37
dam_40,Bumping Lake Dam,"Bumping Lake Dam is an earthfill structure on the Bumping River about 29 miles northwest of Naches. The dam, completed in 1910, is 60 feet high and contains 253,000 cubic yards of material. In 1973, the road crossing the spillway was replaced and a new concrete T-beam bridge was installed to replace a wood-truss bridge. Situated at the lower end of a natural lake, the dam formed a reservoir with an active capacity of 33,700 acre-feet constructed over a natural lake having unknown dead storage capacity. Modifications to Bumping Lake Dam were undertaken in 1994-1997 under the Bureau of Reclamation’s Safety of Dams Program. These modifications included the installation of an interceptor drain at the downstream toe of the dam, construction of downstream and upstream stability berms, replacement of the concrete spillway, installation of a steel liner in the outlet tunnel, and replacement of the outlet channel lining. The outlet gates, gate house, and gate operators were replaced in the early 1990s. Geology The stratigraphy at Bumping Lake consists of Evans Creek Glacial drift (Qde), overlain by the Bumping Lake lahar (Qm) and alluvium (Qal). The alluvium present at the site is composed of reworked drift and lahar materials and is contained to the lowest portion of the valley. The shells of the dam are founded on the alluvium, between approximately stations 13+00 and 15+00. Tumac Mountain is located approximately 11 miles south of the dam. Recent tephra studies near the Tumac Plateau indicate the most recent major eruption occurred between 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. Observations during the excavation of the test pits indicate the materials overlying the glacial drift were volcaniclastic in nature. The material also exhibits an interbedded ash layer, indicating multiple emplacements of the Bumping Lake lahar. The lahar materials mantle the glacial drift to a depth of up to 13 feet near the center of the valley floor and decrease to a thickness of approximately 4 feet at the ends of the dam. The lahar underlies the shells of the embankment, and appears to be continuous for the entire length of the structure, except in the lowest portion of the valley where the shells are founded on alluvium. The cutoff trench appears to have fully penetrated the lahar and was terminated in glacial drift. The thickest portion of the lahar occurs near the outlet works, believed to be the location of the natural channel at the outlet of the ancestral Bumping Lake. The lahar mainly consists of sand with lesser amounts of silt, gravel and basalt cobbles. The lahar contains a large amount of organic debris composed mostly of charred wood. The lahar is classified as silty sand with gravel and cobbles. The uppermost portion of the unit is composed mostly of silty sand to silty sand with gravel. The interbedded volcanic ash, approximately 5 to 10 mm thick, occurred at depths ranging from .4 feet in the upstream test pits to 1.4 feet near the downstream toe of the dam. Just below the ash, the coarseness of the lahar material increases gradually from silty sand with gravel to silty sand with gravel and cobbles. The Evans Creek drift is composed of gravel sand and silt with cobbles and boulders. The gradation of the drift deposit varies greatly, but ranges in classification from poorly graded gravel to poorly graded sand with varying amounts of silt.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=40
dam_1,C.C. Cragin,"The C.C. Cragin Project was completed in 1964, and water storage began in 1965.  C.C. Cragin Dam (formerly Blue Ridge Dam) was designed by the consulting firm of Leeds, Hill and Jewett, Inc. and was constructed by the Phelps Dodge Corporation. The Salt River Project (SRP) transferred ownership of C.C. Cragin Dam and other project features to Reclamation under a Warranty Deed signed on September 30, 2005. C.C. Cragin Dam is located in north central Arizona, in the Coconino National Forest, section 33, T14N, R11E, Gila and Salt River Baseline and Meridian. The structure impounds waters of East Clear Creek, a tributary of Clear Creek and the Little Colorado River. The dam is founded in the geologic unit known as the Coconino sandstone. The Coconino formation is capped by the Kaibab Limestone along a horizontal contact approximately 25 feet below the crest of the dam. The dam is an unsymmetrical thin concrete arch approximately 170 feet high, and with a crest length of 492 feet. The arch varies in thickness from 6 feet at the crest to 14 feet at the base. The arch is seated at its base upon a base block with a “slip plane” consisting of two graphite impregnated asbestos sheet, one bonded to the base block and the other to the arch. The outer sections of the arch rest upon hinge blocks cast on each abutment. The hinge block seats are in the form of a circular socket to provide rocker action. These seats are corrugated transversely for shear resistance. Gravity thrust blocks or buttresses in contact with the arch are provided at the upper end of each hinge block and abutment. Geology -   C. C. Cragin Dam (formerly Blue Ridge Dam and Reservoir) is located on the Mogollon Rim of northern Arizona approximately 23 miles north-northeast of Payson, Arizona. The Mogollon Rim is a 2,000- to 3,000-foot high escarpment that angles diagonally for about 200 miles across north-central Arizona. It marks the boundary of the Colorado Plateau with the Arizona Transition Zone to the southwest. The surface of the Colorado Plateau is composed of sedimentary rocks, primarily rocks of Permian age. At the dam site, East Clear Creek has incised a gorge through the Mogollon Rim and the Permian Kaibab Limestone and into the underlying Coconino Sandstone.  At the dam site, the Kaibab is composed of moderately hard to hard limestone with occasional interbeds of sandstone and occasional chert.  Fractures in the Kaibab are widely spaced, and are occasionally weathered to depths of several meters. The contact between the Kaibab and the underlying Coconino Sandstone forms a prominent erosional notch, visible downstream of the left abutment. Most of the dam, including the base block, hinge blocks, both thrust blocks, and the base of the gravity wall are founded in jointed Coconino Sandstone. The Coconino Sandstone is quartzose, moderately hard, moderately to well cemented, lithified, fine grained eolian sand deposit which exhibits strongly developed cross bedding and variable porosity. The Coconino Sandstone is slightly altered by weathering at the surface and is cut by widely spaced vertical and horizontal fractures.  The Coconino Sandstone is also exposed in the spillway channel below the left abutment of the dam.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=1

dam_55,Carter Lake Dam,"Three dams help form Carter Lake Reservoir. The Reservoir is one of two final storage locations for water diverted from Colorado's West Slope via the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. Water exits the reservoir through Dam No. 1 and the St. Vrain Supply Canal serving communities ranging from Longmont to Boulder and Fort Morgan, Colorado before water is returned to the South Platte River system. Dam No. 1, the largest, occupies a gap across the Dakota sandstone hogback, and ifs founded on Morrison shale and limestone and the Sundance sandstone. The abutments are Dakota sandstone and shale, and all the strata have about 15 degree dip downstream. The geology of Dam No. 2 is somewhat more complex. Due to sharp echelon folding, the hogback structure ends abruptly against a southward plunging anticline. The result is that the foundation strata dip to the southwest into the right abutment, with dips varying from 5 degrees on the right abutment to 70 degrees on the left abutment. The dam rests on upturned edges of the Morrison shale and limestone, Sundance sandstone and the Lykins formation. Dam No. 3 rests entirely on Lyons sandstone.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=55
dam_10,Cascade Dam,"Cascade Dam, near Cascade, Idaho, on the North Fork on the Payette River, is a zoned earthfill structure 785 feet across the crest. The initial total storage capacity was 703,200 acre-feet (active 653,200 acre-feet). The spillway is located on the right abutment of the dam. The invert is 45 feet wide at the crest under the radial gates and about 330 feet long excluding the open cut channel to the reservoir. The design capacity is 12,500 cubic feet per second with the water surface at elevation 4828.0 feet. Two 21-foot wide by 20-foot high radial gates are installed on the crest of the spillway to provide means for regulating the discharge of water over the spillway and to provide protection for the dam in the event of a sudden rise in reservoir water level. A sedimentation survey completed in 1995 at Lake Cascade estimated the total capacity at 693,200 acre-feet (active 646,500 acre-feet). Geology Cascade Dam is sited on igneous rock of granitic type, which generally is of fair quality, but there are numerous localized areas of poor quality. The rock `is light gray coarse-crystalline porphyritic granite and locally is gneissic. It is extremely sheared, conspicuously sheeted and jointed and zones of crushed rock are numerous. Much of the rock is hard, competent and relatively fresh. The dam embankment cutoff trench extends to bedrock and includes a concrete cutoff wall with footings in bedrock. A pressure grout curtain was placed to depth not exceeding 100 feet under the cutoff wall footings. An area of badly broken rock (by blasting) was consolidated with grout. Soils remaining in the embankment foundation upstream and downstream of the cutoff trench are mostly coarse-grained and bouldery, not types considered subject to liquefaction. The gated spillway structure and chute are in a rock cut on the right abutment. The outlet works intake structure and tunnel are on the right side. Foundation rock conditions for the spillway and outlet works are similar to rock described above. An inferred east-west trending fault has been mapped a short distance north on the left abutment. The dam is located within a notch in a bedrock ridge which is interpreted to be a tilted fault block nor an uplift block (horst) related to regional block faulting. The abutments upstream and downstream are natural bedrock slopes, which are stable. The excavated slope of rock adjacent to the spillway and outlet works is stable. None appear to be subject to landslides or rock falls. Basement igneous rocks enclose the basin, which makes the water holding capability of the reservoir satisfactory.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=10

dam_59,Cedar Bluff Dam,"In general, the geologic section exposed in the area consists of surface alluvium, dune sand and terrace deposits of Quaternary age. The older Ogallala (Tertiary) limestones and sandstones lie below these deposits and the yet older Fort Hays Chalk and the Carlisle Shale, both of Cretaceous age. The Smokey Hill River and its main tributaries have cut to a maximum depth 300 feet into nearly horizontal beds of limestone, sandstone, chalk and shale in the vicinity of Cedar Bluff Dam. This ancient river valley is about six miles long. The horizontal formations refereed tops differ in their resistance to erosion, which causes a step-like or bench topography. Cliffs or steep slopes are formed by the more resistant beds and the less resistant beds form gentle slopes. The higher lands bordering the river valley are kept by relatively resistant limestone of the Ogallala formation. This limestone and an underlying section of loosely cemented sand, ""Mortar Beds"", appear as predominate white outcrops. These outcrops mark the edge of the ""Ogallala Upland"".

dam_63,Cheney Dam,"The North Fork of Ninnescah River has eroded a broad shallow valley through sand and clay beds of the Tertiary Ogallala formation, which form the uplands. The valley lies in the lower part of the Permian ""red beds"" in the Ninnescah formation at the base of the Cimarron group. The ""red beds"" are underlain by shale, salt and anhydrite of the Wellington formation in the Big Blue group of the Permian series. The region is underlain by several thousand feet of marine sedimentaries. Soil and slopewash up to 15 feet thick blanket the sides of the valley. In places, alluvial terraces of gravelly sand up to 35 feet thick are present. Floodplain deposits of silty, clayey sand and gravelly sand range up to 40 feet thick. The upland on the right side of the valley is composed of sand and clay beds believed to constitute the lower part of the Ogallala formation. On the left side these beds are missing. The rock series, which forms the floor and sides of the reservoir basin, is composed principally of shale, the lower portion of which is gypsiferous. This shale series, about 100 feet thick, together with 20 feet of underlying shale, constitute parts of the Permian Ninnescah and Wellington formations. Beneath there are several thousand feet of sedimentaries including shale, limestone, salt and anhydrite. The Ninnescah shale formation, which crops out at a few places on the sides of the basin, appears to have regional dip at a slight angle to the southwest, modified in places by gentle monoclinal folds. No faulting is known. Jointing is common in the shale beds, probable a result of structural flexing.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=63

dam_306,Cle Elum Dam,"Cle Elum Dam, on the Cle Elum River 10 miles northwest of Cle Elum, is an earthfill dam constructed at the end of a natural lake that forms a reservoir with an active capacity of 436,900 acre-feet. The dam is 165 feet high and, including the dikes, contains 1,411,000 cubic yards of material. The outlet works of Cle Elum Dam were modified in 1977-1979 under the Bureau of Reclamation’s Safety of Dams Program. Geology Cle Elum Dam and Lake Cle Elum lie within the U-shaped glacial valley of the Cle Elum River. Successive multiple advances of alpine glaciers during the Pleistocene have formed this U-shaped valley. The terminal moraine/outwash complex, which was deposited during the most recent Pleistocene glacial advance, essentially blocked drainage of the valley forming a natural dam. Following deglaciation, a lake was formed behind the terminal moraine. The moraine was subsequently breached, and a deep channel was incised through the moraine and outwash deposits, forming the outlet of the glacial lake currently known as Lake Cle Elum. The high-stand water level of the glacial lake was very close to the maximum water surface of the existing Lake Cle Elum. Cle Elum Dam, main dike, and three smaller saddle dikes are sited along the crest of the youngest terminal moraine described above. This glacial moraine received its name, Domerie, after the Domerie Flats, an extensive outwash terrace immediately downstream from the dam. The moraine, which is about 60,000 to 65,000 years old, consists of unconsolidated sediments ranging in size from rock flour to boulders. Its thickness is estimated from drill hole investigations downstream of the dam. Investigations at the dam site have never penetrated the glacial moraine to bedrock. Bedrock in the vicinity of Cle Elum Dam includes various volcanic and sedimentary units.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=306
dam_69,Clear Creek Dam,"Clear Creek Dam, a concrete thin-arch structure on the North Fork of the Tieton River about 30 miles southwest of Naches and 48 miles west of Yakima, creates a reservoir with an active capacity of 5,300 acre-feet. The dam is 83 feet high and contains 5,800 cubic yards of concrete. Originally constructed in 1914, the dam was raised 21 feet in 1918 to its present height. Rehabilitation work in 1964 consisted primarily of placing new concrete in the arch section between elevation 2,991.0 and the crest, repairing cracks and poorly consolidated concrete with neoprene and epoxies, and installing protective wire-mesh fences from the abutments to upstream areas. As the result of investigations conducted in 1987-1989, the Bureau of Reclamation concluded there were horizontal bands of deteriorated concrete in the section replaced in 1964. These conditions could result in sudden failure of the dam. The water level of Clear Lake was immediately lowered to reduce the likelihood of dam failure. Early in 1990, two holes were cut through the dam to further drain the lake to a point that only 230 acre-feet could be stored. Overwhelming public support was expressed for reconstructing the dam and returning Clear Lake to its original condition, due mostly to the loss of recreational value. Reconstruction was accomplished through local, State, and Federal funding and consisted of converting the dam into a gravity structure by buttressing the arch with a new concrete section immediately downstream. A new 48-inch outlet conduit was installed near the elevation of the breach (2956.5 feet) to permit discharge whenever the lake was below the spillway crest. Clear Lake is now used primarily for recreation and most of the discharge is by the spillway. Geology The dam foundation is composed of a metamorphosed sill of highly fractured, basic porphyritic rock of Tertiary age, altered at the surface to serpentine and epidote. Field examination showed this rock to be solidly keyed and fused together, competent to support thedam, and highly resistant to erosion.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=69
dam_27,Clear Lake Dam,"Clear Lake Dam and Reservoir on the Lost River in California, about 19 miles southeast of Malin, Oregon, provide storage for irrigation and reduce flow into the reclaimed portion of Tule Lake and the restricted Tule Lake Sumps in Tulelake National Wildlife Refuge. The dam is a roller compacted concrete structure with a height of 42 feet and a crest length of 840 feet. The reservoir has a capacity of 527,000 acre-feet. Clear Lake Reservoir is a reservoir in northwestern Modoc County, California in the Modoc National Forest about 40 mi (64 km) northwest of Alturas. It is formed by Clear Lake Dam on the Lost River and has a capacity of 527,000 acre feet (650,000,000 m³). The reservoir should not be confused with Clear Lake, a large natural lake on Cache Creek in Lake County, California. The original dam was constructed of rockfill and was completed in 1910. It was 42 feet (13 m) tall from the bottom of the foundation to the crest, 32 ft (10 m) if measured from the crest to the original streambed. It was replaced with a concrete dam near the old dam in 2002. The old dam had deteriorated and the water level was kept low to prevent it from failing. Its crest is at the same height as the old dam and the reservoir's capacity is about the same. The dam is owned by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. It was built to reduce flows into the reclaimed wetlands of Tule Lake. It also reduces flows into Tule Lake Sumps in the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge. The reservoir created by the dam has a very large surface area, 25,760 acres (104.2 km²), and its average depth at maximum capacity is only about 20 feet (6 m), so it has a very high rate of evaporation. In 1998, 74,500 acre feet (92,000,000 m³) of water from the reservoir evaporated, more than any other lake in the state besides Shasta Lake, which has over 8 times the volume. Because of this, Clear Lake Reservoir is not an efficient water storage reservoir. This is a problem since the dam now provides water for irrigation of the eastern half of the Klamath Basin. The reservoir is in Modoc National Forest and Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge, so recreation opportunities are limited.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=27
dam_29,Cold Springs Dam,"Cold Springs Dam is a zoned earthfill type with a structural height of 115 feet and a volume of 793,000 cubic yards. Cold Springs Reservoir is located offstream about 6 miles northeast of Hermiston, Oregon. Water is diverted to the reservoir from the Umatilla River by the Feed Canal Diversion Dam and Canal. The reservoir’s total active capacity is39,260 acre-feet (active38,646 acre-feet). Safety of Dams work in 1994-1995 included the construction of an interceptor trench and drain at the downstream toe of the embankment, a downstream stability berm, extension of the wing dikes, replacement of the spillway with an enlarged roller compacted concrete structure, and a new Feed Canal backflow structure. Geology A few large exposures of basaltic lave bedrock (Columbia River basalt) can be seen on the valley sides downstream from the dam; alluvium and/or windblown silt cover hut throughout most of the area bedrock. The alluvium appears to be chiefly sand, but beds of gravel and numerous cobbles and boulders can be seen at various places.The alluvium is thick, widespread deposit from a tremendous flood, which covered the area in late glacial times.In the spillway area bedrock is exposed only near the downstream end of the chute along the left wall.In this exposure the basalt is rather soft, crumbly and closely jointed. It is not highly resistant to erosion.Small exposures of basalt can be found at several places in the right hillside between the creek and spillway, but no rock was recognized on the right side of the spillway except at the downstream end.In a cliff along the right canyon wall about 300 feet left (east) of the spillway a considerable thickness of hard, fresh highly resistant basalt also occurs.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=29
dam_30,Como Dam,"Como Dam was completed in 1910 by local irrigators and rehabilitated on its crest and upstream face by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1954. This semi hydraulic earthfill dam at the end of a natural lake is 70 feet high with a crest length of 2,550 feet and contains 1,114,000 cubic yards of earth and rock. In 1976, the district built concrete protection walls on each side of the spillway section up to elevation 4,249.0 feet, the same elevation as the crest of the dam. Under the Safety of Dams Program, designs for the walls were furnished to the district to correct low points in the dam fill adjacent to the spillway. Between 1992 and 1994, major modifications to Como Dam were performed to mitigate concerns associated with seepage and piping, liquidfication during a large seismic event, and overtopping during large floods. During these modifications, the spillway crest was raised to elevation 4246.0 feet increasing the active reservoir capacity from 35,100 acre-feet to 38,500 acre feet. The State of Montana paid for this work and obtained 3,000 acre-feet of capacity for storing water to use in enhancing minimum streamflows in the Bitterroot River.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=30
dam_32,Conconully Dam,"Conconully Dam is a hydraulic earthfill structure that when completed in 1910 was 70 feet high, and contained 359,000 cubic yards of fill. In 1920, the dam was raised 2.5 feet. Total capacity of the reservoir is 13,000 acre-feet (active 13,000 acre-feet). During 1968-69, the crest of the dam was repaired with new embankment materials and riprap. The old open-chute concrete spillway that had an inadequate capacity of 6,000 cubic feet per second was replaced with a concrete-baffled apron spillway that has a capacity of 11,580 cubic feet per second. Geology Conconully is located in Okanogan Highlands a mountainous district bordered by the Columbia Plateau to the south and the Cascade Mountains to the west, and includes the Colville Mountains which apparently represent a continuation of the higher mountains in British Columbia. The damsite is located in the southern end of the glaciated valley.The effect of the glacial ice was to scour out a depression below the surrounding area much like an enclosed valley.Granite rock generally forms the right wall of the valley; however, at the damsite elevation there exists a short ridge of metamorphic sedimentary rock. The left abutment and left valley wall are formed in metamorphic sedimentary rock. The valley floor is composed of deposited glacial and alluvial materials such as silt, clay, sand and gravel,as well asboulders and blocks of rock.The spillway is located in the rock ridge of the right abutment.The outlet works was excavated through the metamorphic sedimentary rock comprising the left abutment.The rock is gneiss; light to medium gray on a fresh surface it weathers and oxidizes to a grayish brown.The rock is hard where unweathered and moderately jointed.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=32
dam_34,Contra Loma Dam,"Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir is located in a small off-stream valley on the northeast flank of the Los Medanos Hills, about 2.5 km south of Antioch, California. The Los Medanos Hills consist of a generally north dipping sequence of Tertiary strata on the north margin of the Mt. Diablo uplift, and on the southwestern margin of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In the vicinity of the dam and reservoir the relief of the rolling hills ranges up to about 200 m. The relief increases rapidly to the west and south and decreases to the north and east in the delta area. In the immediate vicinity of the dam and reservoir the hills are mantled by clayey residual soil, colluvium, and alluvium, and are underlain by a sequence of moderately lithified Tertiary nonmarine and marine sedimentary rocks assigned, in ascending order, to the Eocene Kreyenhagen Formation, the Oligocene Kirker Formation, the Miocene Cierbo Formation, the Mio-Pliocene Neroly Formation, and the Pliocene Wolfskill Formation. The formation contacts generally strike north-northwest east-southeast, and dip to the north at angles up to about 25 degrees. Bedding within these formations is cut by several sets of joints, and locally by minor faults with up to a few feet of offset. The reservoir is in a small valley enclosed between low ridges and rather steep-sided rolling hills which support tall grasses and a sparse growth of trees. Two gentle saddles in the ridge along the east edge of the reservoir required low dikes. Most of the reservoir floor is blanketed by residual clayey soil , accumulations of fine-grained slopewash, and alluvium, except in the central portion where most of the surficial material was removed for use as impervious embankment. The northern (downstream) half of the reservoir is underlain by the Pliocene Wolfskill Formation of poorly lithified claystone, siltstone, and interbedded sandstone. Elsewhere, the marine Mio-Pliocene Neroly Formation of lithified Sandstone and interbedded, moderately lithified, claystone underlies the reservoir. The residual clays (CL-CH) vary in depth from a few inches to nearly 6 feet. The bedrock beneath the soil cover consists of layers of shale, siltstone, and sandstone which trend east-west (nearly parallel to the darn axis) and dip 10 to 25 degrees northward (downstream). Some of the layers air slake when exposed, and some water slake.

dam_38,Crane Prairie Dam,"Crane Prairie Dam was built by several local irrigation districts serving lands south of the North Unit, principally the Central Oregon Irrigation District. It is a rockfill timber-crib dam about 2 miles above Wickiup Reservoir on the Deschutes River. By the time work began on the North Unit, the dam had become unsafe and was rehabilitated by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1940. Crane Prairie Dam is an earthfill structure 36 feet high and 284 feet in length at its crest. It contains 30,000 cubic yards of material. The spillway is an uncontrolled weir in the floor of an open cut channel in the left abutment. The reservoir has a total capacity of 55,300 acre-feet (active 55,300 acre-feet). The right wall of the spillway was raised 9 feet in 1992 to enable passage of 60 percent of the probable maximum flood without overtopping the dam. Geology Crane Prairie Dam and reservoir are situated in forest covered volcanic mountains, consisting of buttes, craters and intervening sediment covered basins. The intermittent out-pouring of lava flows and explosive volcanic activity has created very complex geologic situations in local areas. The porous lava flows, breccia, ash and deposits of water lain sediment can be linked to a huge absorptive sponge with local perched or depressed water tables, where lakes and springs have been created at various elevations, according to the rate of inflow or outflow of water as it adjusts to local topographic and geologic conditions. The readjustments of the earth's crust during and following volcanic activity undoubtedly created huge cracks, fissures and faults through which the surface water can be lost or move to lower subsurface elevations.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=38
dam_39,Crawford Dam,"Crawford Dam is an earthfill structure 162 feet high and 580 feet long, with a volume of 1,006,000 cubic yards. The uncontrolled overflow spillway is in the left abutment of the dam and has a capacity of 1,400 cubic feet per second. The outlet works in the right abutment of the dam carries water through a 34-inch-diameter steel pipe controlled by four 2.25-foot-square high-pressure gates. Maximum discharge capacity to Aspen Canal is 125 cubic feet per second. Crawford Reservoir has a total capacity of 14,395 acre-feet and an active capacity of 14,064 acre-feet. The reservoir has a surface area of 406.2 acres. Geology Crawford Dam is located in a narrow gouge. Dakota sandstone and Mancos shale are exposed on both abutments, which are steep. In the sandstone, a system of strike joints that trend N 15 degrees E is found along the gorge, and these joints have opened up most noticeably where the stream parallels the jointing. The weathered sandstone in some areas of the abutment required as much as 25 feet of excavation before acceptable rock was found. The valley section of Crawford Dam is founded on approximately 65 feet of predominately fine-grained alluvial deposits of silty and sandy clay with a few lenses of sand and gravel and sandstone boulders that accumulated as slope wash from the canyon sides. Logs of preconstruction drill holes in the alluvium (Qal) indicate the clay varies widely in thickness, ranging from less than 5 feet to over 50 feet; there also are a few zones of sand, sand and gravel, and gravel and cobbles, but they do not appear to be connected. Beneath the alluvial deposits are friable-to-well-cemented sandstone with thin interbeds of carbonaceous shale and siltstone of the Dakota Formation. The sandstone is often quite broken and has a conspicuous joint system. Beneath the Dakota Formation is the Morrison Formation which is composed of variegated siltstone and mudstone. Artesian flows of water were encountered in pre-construction drill holes coming from either the contact between the Dakota and Morrison Formations or the alluvial deposits and the underlying Morrison Formation. During construction grouting, drill holes extending to depths of 100 feet (near the top of the Morrison Formation) took as much as 2,200 sacks of cement per hole. Evidence suggests a highly permeable confined or semi-confined aquifer is present in the upper Morrison formation which is locally connected to pockets, lenses, and layers of coarse grained alluvium deposited on the bedrock surface and overlain by clay. The spillway excavation was predominately in the Dakota sandstone. The depth of overburden varied considerably as an old stream channel was found across the spillway alignment. The stilling basin was excavated in mudstone of the Morrison formation. The outlet works tunnel in the right abutment was entirely in the Dakota formation, consisting of friable- to well-cemented sandstone, as well as some thin beds of shale and siltstone, and fractured rock. Prior to construction, it was anticipated that the ground water was trapped water, and the water would drain out when the tunnel was driven. Contrary to anticipations, there was a persistent flow of ground water along the tunnel alignment.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=39

dam_47,Davis Dam,"Davis Dam spans the Colorado River in Pyramid Canyon 67 miles downstream from Hoover Dam and 88 miles upstream from Parker Dam. The Mexican Treaty of 1944 required the United States to construct Davis Dam for regulation of water to be delivered to Mexico. The reservoir formed by the dam, Lake Mohave, is used for that purpose through integrated operations of Hoover and Davis Powerplants. Davis Dam, rising 200 feet above the lowest point of the foundation and about 140 feet above the level of the river, is a zoned earthfill structure with concrete spillway, intake structure, and powerplant. It has a crest length of 1,600 feet, and a top width of 50 feet. Its reservoir, Lake Mohave, has a total storage capacity of 1,818,300 acre-feet, and at maximum capacity extends 67 miles upstream to the tailrace of the Hoover Powerplant. Almost 5 million cubic yards of rock and earth were excavated to form the diversion and forebay channel and foundations for the dam, spillway and intake structures, and powerplant. More than 3,642,000 cubic yards of earth and rockfill were required to form the dam, and about 600,000 cubic yards of concrete and 23 million pounds of reinforcing steel were placed in the spillway, powerplant, and other structures.

dam_76,Deer Creek Dam,"Deer Creek Dam is located on the Provo River about 16 miles northeast of Provo, Utah. It is a zoned earthfill structure 235 feet high with a crest length of 1,304 feet. The dam contains 2,810,000 cubic yards of material and forms a reservoir of 152,570 acre-foot capacity. The spillway is a concrete chute at the right abutment controlled by two radial gates. The capacity of the spillway is 12,000 cubic feet per second. The outlet works through the left abutment is a concrete-lined tunnel from the trashrack to the gate chamber, from which two steel pipes lead to the powerplant. Releases are controlled by two tube valves. The outlet works has a capacity of 1,500 cubic feet per second. Geology The dam and outlet works tunnel are founded in limestone, shaley limestone, and quartzose sandstone of the Pennsylvanian Oquirrh Formation. Rock units dip upstream at 30 degrees. Alluvial deposits up to 86 feet deep underlie the shells of the dam and spillway. A positive cutoff was achieved by excavation a cutoff trench through the river alluvium, grouting the foundation rock, and constructing a concrete cutoff wall. The rock was fractured, but no faults were found in the foundation. An additional shallow cutoff trench was excavated beneath the zone 2 downstream of the core to remove a 4-to15-foot-thick sequence of clay and organic material.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=76
dam_13,Deer Flat Lower Embankment,"Lake Lowell, originally known as Deer Flat Reservoir, is an offstream reservoir formed by three earthfill dams enclosing a natural depression southwest of Nampa, Idaho. These three dams are the Upper, Middle (Forest Dam), and Lower Embankments. A fourth embankment called the East (Roadway Dike) is to protect farmsteads on the eastern end of the reservoir when the reservoir is full. The reservoir is filled primarily during the non-irrigation season by diversions at the Boise River Diversion Dam and conveyance through the New York Canal which discharges into the eastern (upper) end of Lake Lowell. The Upper Embankment on the north side of the reservoir is65 feet high and has two outlets; near the right abutment is the Deer Flat Nampa Canal (100 cubic feet per second) and near the left abutment is the Deer Flat Caldwell Canal (70 cubic feet per second). The Lower Embankment at the west end of the reservoir is 41 feet high. The Deer Flat Low Line Canal (1,200 cubic feet per second) outlets are on the left abutment and the Deer Flat North Canal (70 cubic feet per second) outlets are on the right abutment. The Middle Embankment, which has no outlets, is 12.7 feet high and helps to close the reservoir near the Lower Embankment. It has been referred to as an emergency spillway; however, no slope protection is provided for this purpose. Because ofsafety concerns at the Upper and Lower Embankments, the maximum water level was reduced by 5 feet in 1989 while plans were prepared to address remedial actions. Major modifications were made to the Upper and Lower Embankments from 1991 to 1993.

dam_100,Deerfield Dam,"Deerfield Dam is located within the Precambrian core in the southeastern portion of the Black Hills Uplift. It is situated between two bluffs composed primarily of steeply dipping phyllite and quartz mica schist. The structural attitude of the bedding and scistosity indicate that the site is located near the plunging crest of an overturned major fold. Change in foliation trends at the site indicate that Precambrian folding and faulting on a minor have also occurred. The foliation or schistosity tends to parallel the hillside on the left abutment and dips obliquely upstream across the dam into the right abutment. Because weathering tends to follow down the foliation planes, rock on the left abutment was found to be generally hard, moderately fractured and had shallow weathering, while rock through the stream channel and the right abutment was highly fractured and weathered to depths in excess of 30 feet. The original valley floor consisted of an organic silt about 4 feet thick overlying 10 to 15 feet of water-bearing sand and gravel.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=100

Hughes Stadium, where the Colorado State University Rams play football, sits just to the north of Dixon's left abutment. Dixon Canyon was formed by the erosion of a narrow notch through the north-south ridge of tilted Dakota sandstone. The formations involved are the same as those at Spring Canyon and Soldier Canyon dams, sister east-facing dams at Horsetooth. The geologic formations include the Sundance, Morrison and Dakota. There are some differences in the thicknesses and intervals especially in the Dakota group. The rock floor under the dam is mostly Morrison shales and thin limestones with some on the lower and middle Dakota sandstones under the down stream face. The formations are all dipping downstream at an angle of 23 degrees. Bedrock is covered by a strip of alluvium down to the bottom of the canyon approximately 200 feet wide. It widens too more than 400 feet upstream from the centerline. Nearly all of the slopes on each side are conferred with gravel, soil and boulders except where the harder rocks crop out.

dam_84,Dry Falls Dam,"North and Dry Falls Dams, two rock-faced, earthfill dams at the north and south ends of the Ice-Age channel of the Columbia River, now known as the Grand Coulee, form Banks Lake, the equalizing reservoir. This 27-mile-long reservoir, with an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet, feeds Columbia River water into the Main Canal. In addition, it provides water on a return flow basis to produce power when the pump generating units are operating in the generating mode. Major features forming and serving Banks Lake are the feeder canal with a capacity of 26,000 cubic feet per second, North Dam, 2 miles southwest of Grand Coulee Dam, and Dry Falls Dam and Main Canal headworks near Coulee City, 29 miles south of Grand Coulee Dam. In conjunction with the addition of the six pump/generating units, the canal size was increased. The south side of the canal was removed, the base widened from 50 feet to 80 feet, an entire new south wall constructed, 8 feet added to the top of the north wall, and a new flume section was added to bypass a duplex tunnel cut-and-cover section. This increased the operating capacity to 26,000 cubic feet per second. Reconstruction was completed in 1981. Geology Dry Falls Dam is located 43 km within the area underlain by the massive basalt flows of the Columbia Plateau lava. The flows dip gently to the north under most of the foundation, but rise to the west in a steep monocline. Jointing is closely spaced but tight in the flows. Fractures are irregular and wide spaced even in the rocks of the monocline. Interflow zones of various widths separate the flows. The site is in a wide, steep-walled valley cut in basalt. On a large scale, the floor appears quite flat, but in detail narrow channels as much as 18m deep are present and numerous rock knobs and closed basins dot the floor. Except in the channels where thick deposits of silt are present overburden is thin and swamp deposits cover many low areas. Except where zone 2 and 3 of the dam overlie deep channels all structures are founded on basalt. Deep layers of silt were left under zones 2 and 3 in the channel areas. At the damsite the rock has exceptional bearing strength and vertical permeability is very low. Horizontal permeability is low within the mass of the flow and ranges from low to high in the interflow zones.

It consists of an impervious central core flanked by zones of relatively free-draining material grading to pervious at the outer slopes of the dam. The upstream zone is designed to resist percolation of the afterbay water and to dissipate internal pressures exerted outwardly during rapid afterbay drawdowns. The downstream zones protects the impervious central core and stabilizes the dam by lowering the saturation line in the downstream area. The cutoff trench beneath the dam is designed to obstruct percolation along the foundation contact to prevent dangerous seepage velocities. The stability of the dam is further safeguarded by the embankment toe drains which intercept seepage along the foundation contact and surface flow from within the dam. The toe drains are designed to permit easy escape of the seepage and to lower the ground water table sufficiently to avoid the formation of boggy areas below the dam.,https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=72
dam_74,Folsom Dam,"Folsom Dam and Reservoir is a major water management facility located within a large metropolitan area. With a capacity of 976,000 acre-feet, the Folsom Reservoir catches runoff from the extensive American River watershed and are the key flood control structures protecting the Sacramento metropolitan area. The Central California Area Office is headquartered at Folsom Dam, 23 miles east of California’s capital city of Sacramento, with resource offices located at New Melones and Lake Berryessa. The area office manages water and land resources in 12 counties, including facilities of the Central Valley Project - American River, Auburn-Folsom South Unit and East Side Divisions, and facilities of the Solano Project. The office's jurisdiction extends from the coast to the crest of the Sierra, and from the American River Basin to the Stanislaus River Basin. The Central California Area Office also manages the recreation areas at Lake Berryessa and New Melones reservoir, has a long-term lease with the California Department of Parks and Recreation for Folsom Lake, Lake Natoma and Auburn area, and an agreement with the California Division of Forestry to manage the lands associated with the Auburn Unit. (Above alternate photo) The auxiliary spillway was constructed adjacent to Folsom's main concrete dam, 23 miles northeast of Sacramento. Substantially completed in October 2017, it includes a 1,100-foot-long approach channel beginning in Folsom Reservoir, a concrete control structure with six bulkhead and six radial gates, a 3,100-foot-long auxiliary spillway chute, and a stilling basin that acts as an energy dissipation structure as water discharges and enters the American River. With the ability to operate the new spillway, Reclamation is able to better manage large floods by safely releasing more water from Folsom Reservoir earlier in a storm through both the spillway gates on Folsom Dam and the new control structure’s radial gates (which sit 50 feet lower), reducing hydrologic risk and leaving more storage capacity in the reservoir.

dam_138,Fruitgrowers Dam,"Fruitgrowers Dam, located on Alfalfa Run, is 3 miles north of Austin, Colorado. It is an earthfill, rock-faced structure, 55 feet high and 1,520 feet long, containing 136,000 cubic yards of material. The reservoir stores a total of 4,540 acre-feet of water. The spillway, located on the left side of the dam, is an uncontrolled structure (meaning flows aren't regulated). A 76-foot-long concrete-lined channel discharges into a stilling basin which slows the velocity and reduces the energy of the water. The outlet works consists of one 3-foot diameter pipe controlled by two slide gates. Geology Bedrock at Fruitgrowers Dam is Mancos Shale of Cretaceous age. The Mancos Shale is a dark gray marine formation and has a gentle northerly dip in the vicinity of the dam. The shale is brown, soft, and has abundant secondary gypsum present when weathered. There is no evidence of faulting in the foundation area of the dam.On the left abutment, the shale is covered with a thin layer of clay slope wash. The topography of this abutment suggests the presence of land-slide or slump deposits. Two inclinometers have all shown slight movements within the abutment. These inclinometers have all shown slight movement in a northwest direction at rates of 0.2 to 0.4 inches per year (0.5 to 1.0 cm/year). These movements are occurring at depths of 20 to 40 feet (6 to 12 m).In the valley bottom, stream alluvium was found to be up to 23 feet (7 m) thick over Mancos Shale. This alluvium is composed of clayey and gravelly soils and contains some basalt cobbles and boulders.The right abutment is a gently sloping area with deep glacial outwash deposits over the shale bedrock. These deposits were found to be up to 155 feet thick and contain gravel, cobbles, and boulders of basalt derived from the lava flows on Grand Mesa.Readings of observation wells installed in 1979 indicate the presence of two ground water systems at Fruitgrowers Dam.

dam_149,Glen Elder Dam,"The Solomon River has carved a broad U-shaped valley into flat-lying Cretaceous-aged sedimentary rocks at the site of Glen Elder Dam. The valley walls which serve as abutments for the dam are composed of limestone and shales primarily of Greenhorn Limestone; the upper portion of abutments are chalky shale and limestones of the Carlile Shale. The upper surface of these rocks are weathered to depths of 20 to 30 feet; near vertical joints are common. A thin 10 to 20-foot mantle of loessal silts and clays with some sand forms the upper surface of the left abutment. A near vertical bluff of limestone and shale, which was formed by downcutting of the river and excavation for the railroad line, is the inner edge of the left abutment. Ten to 20 feet of eolian silt and clay also cap the Carlile Shale and Greenhorn Limestone of the right abutment.

The original dam was modified for the Third Power Plant by construction of a 1,170-foot-long, 201-foot-high forebay dam along the right abutment approximately parallel to the river and at an angle of 64 degrees to the axis of Grand Coulee Dam. The total length of the main dam, forebay dam, and wing dam is 5,223 feet. The spillway of the dam is controlled by 11 drum gates, each 135 feet long, and is capable of spilling 1 million cubic feet of water per second with Lake Roosevelt at fullpool (1290.0 feet above sea level). The dam also contains forty 102- inch-diameter outlet tubes. Within the dam are 8.5 miles of inspection galleries and 2.5 miles of shafts. Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, the reservoir behind the dam, extends 151 miles northeast to the Canadian border and up the Spokane River, a tributary of the Columbia, to within 37 miles of Spokane.

dam_166,Grassy Lake Dam,"Grassy Lake Dam is a 118-foot-high zoned earthfill storage dam on Grassy Creek in Wyoming near the southern boundary of Yellowstone National Park. The reservoir has a total storage capacity of 15,500 acre-feet (active 15,200 acre-feet) which supplements the storage at Island Park. Storage at Grassy Lake Dam is augmented by a 0.7-mile canal from Cascade Creek which is fed from the Cascade Creek Diversion Dam, a rockfilled log crib weir that is 14 feet high. Recent operation and maintenance modifications included the installation of a seepage blanket and drain at the toe of the dam in 1996 and 1997. In 2004-2006 the spillway was replaced due to advanced deterioration, additional toe drains and seepage blankets were also constructed. Geology The site is located on the Yellowstone Plateau. The geology is a complex sequence of volcanism and glaciation. The foundation and abutments are comprised of interlayered volcanic bedrock and glacial deposits, overlain by recent alluvium in the stream channel. Annual rainfall exceeds 48 inches in all but the driest years, and grouting, drains, and other measures were required during construction to control seeps and springs in the work area.Prior to embankment placement, the foundation was stripped to bedrock or to dense, heavily over-consolidated silty glacial sediments over most of its area. Near the maximum section, where the embankment bears on bedrock, cut-off walls project upward into the fill 5 to 10 feet and downward 3 feet into rock, and the bedrock was grouted extensively. Elsewhere, a cut-off trench was excavated as deep as 25 feet into the silty glacial sediments. At the dam site, the foundation was excavated to the Lewis Canyon Rhyolite in the central stream channel area (about 300 feet wide), except at the downstream toe where the bedrock dips sharply downstream and the dam is founded on alluvium consisting of sand, gravel, cobbles, and boulders with some stringers of fine, loose sand. The Lewis Canyon formation consists of multiple flows of rhyolite, glassy rhyolite, and obsidian, which are quite variable in nature.The abutments of the dam are founded on dense, fine-grained lacustrine sediments, probably the result of glaciation and deposition on the irregular eroded surface of the Lewis Canyon Rhyolite. The sediments are composed predominantly of plastic silt and clay with small amounts of sand, having plasticity indices (PI) from 4 to 16. The ""clay"" fraction is primarily rock flour, rather than clay minerals. A gravelly glacial-alluvial deposit that was a source of troublesome groundwater seepage during construction is located within this formation on the right abutment between elevations 7172 and 7188. The remainder of the sediment is low in permeability, and acts as a confining layer for artesian pressure within the underlying rhyolite. The Lava Creek welded ash-flow tuff is present in the right abutment above approximate elevation 7200. It is hard and dense with irregular joints and strong flow banding. This rock unit was quarried upstream to provide rockfill and riprap for the dam. Later glacial deposits, colluvium, and slopewash are present on the slopes above and near the dam, but do not constitute foundation materials.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=166

The right aburment consists of Thermopolis shale. Both the Cloverly and Thermopolis Formations dip gently in a downstream direstion with a strike approsimately parallel to the axis of Gray Reef Dam. The left abutment of the dam is sand and gravel underlain by Cloverly sandstone. The location of the dam axis was shifted approximately 290 feet downstream as a result of subsurface conditions revealed by exploratory borings. The second axis was chosen because there was a smaller amount of overburden above bedrock and the quality of bedrock was superior. The bedrock at the original dam axis way a claystone of the Morrison Formation. There was approximately 6 feet of gravel overlying the sandstone bedrock in the streambed along the second axis. To the west of the left abutment, the sand, gravel and silt comprising the terrace of an old flood plain rises to an elevation higher than the top of the dam. This gravel deposit thickens towards the left valley wall. The foundation preparation for the spillway structure consisted of stripping the overburden and exposing the bedrock. For the embankment sections, the soft, loose overburden was stripped to expose competent sands or gravels and a cutoff trench was excavated down to the rock surface. The cutoff trench is located under the crest of the dam and has a bottom width of 20 feet at the contact with bedrock. Near the left abutment, where the bedrock dips downward, the cutoff trench was extended to bedrock until the depth to rock exceeded 5 feet. The cutoff trench then became a key trench, excavated to a maximum depth of 5 feet. There has been a problem with seepage through the foundation gravels underlying the left abutment. A study into this seepage was completed in 1962. Conclusions noted that the seepage is related to the reservoir level and probably poses no threat to the safety of Gray Reef Dam. The seepage surfaces downstream of the left abutment and creates an unsightly area that is troublesome to visitors because it is difficult to walk or drive on the soft ground. The area affected by the seepage is a popular public fishing spot. Ten observation wells have been installed to monitor water level measurements and a shallow, subsurface drainage system has been installed to collect and discharge the seepage to the North Platte River.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=292

dam_183,Haystack Dam,"Haystack Dam is a zoned earthfill offstream storage facility located about 10 miles south of Madras, Oregon. Most of the stored water in the reservoir is diverted from the North Unit Main Canal which receives its water from Wickiup Reservoir. Releases from Haystack Reservoir flow in a feeder canal back to the North Unit Main Canal for use in the service area. The feeder canal also acts as a spillway. Because of the distance from Wickiup Reservoir to the lands of the North Unit, the regulatory storage provided by the 5,600 acre-foot Haystack Reservoir is required. The dam is an earthfill structure, 105 feet high at its crest with a width of 25 feet and length of 1,200 feet, containing 535,000 cubic yards of material. Geology Bedrock at the damsite was mapped as the John Day Formation. This mapping indicates the dam is a member of the formation consisting of rhyolite, ash-flow sheets, bedded, welded and lapilli tuffs with interbedded tuffaceous sedimentary rock. The implied source area for the volcanic material is Juniper Butte; a rhyolite dome with associated flows located two miles southwest of the dam. Robinson infers a north 75-degree trending fault one half mile south of Haystack Dam. The fault displaces John Day Formation and the underlying Clarno Formation but does not cut the younger Madras Formation surrounding the butte and overlapping the older formation. Surficial deposits on the valley floor along the axis of the dam ranged from 0 to 24 feet in depth. These deposits were alluviums, consisting of silty sand, coarse sand, clayey sand and gravel. Toward the left abutment the overburden deposits were alluvium and talus and near the base of the slope about 30 feet thick. Bedrock under the surficial deposits in the valley consisted of rhyolite and tuff and was exposed at the surface near the top of both abutments.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=183

dam_113,Helena Valley Dam,"Water flowing from Helena Valley Tunnel at mile 2.8 discharges into the 300-cubic-foot-per-second Helena Valley Canal. The Canal is 31.7 miles long, with 10.2 miles unlined and 21.5 miles lined at mile 11, the canal discharges into a 10,500-acre-foot-capacity regulating reservoir. Helena Valley Dam, which forms the reservoir, is an earthfill structure 91 feet high, with a crest length of 2,650 feet. A 600-foot-long dike extends from the left abutment of the dam. The reservoir has 5,900 acre-feet of conservation storage for irrigation and municipal water. A outlet built into the dams supplies municipal water to the city of Helena. The 350-cubic-feet-per-second outlet to the Helena Valley Canal is located in the dike. Between the reservoir and mile 17, the canal provides facilities for future supplemental service to 10 irrigation ditches which have been diverting water from Prickly Pear Creek; between miles 17 and 22, facilities are provided for supplemental service to existing ditches diverting water from Prickly Pear and Tenmile Creeks. The canal terminates at Lake Helena, which occupies the lower part of the valley. The reservoir area upstream from the dam has been earth blanketed to reduce seepage from the reservoir, and pressure relief wells have been installed near the downstream toe of the dam. These measure have not been totally effective and other measures are being considered to relieve the uplift pressures on the downstream toe of the dam. Foundation consists of an alternating sequence of tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, and conglomerate beds. These sediments are part of the Bozeman beds of Paleocene to the Miocene Age. Numerous faults and fractures cut these strata beneath and adjacent to the dam. One fault with a displacement of about 200 feet trends northward through the right abutment of the dam. Some fault and fracture zones have been healed by clastic material intruded during earthquake. Since initial filling of the reservoir in late 1959, excessive seepage and hydrostatic pressures under the dam have been encountered.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=113
dam_118,Heron Dam,"The damsite is situated on the northeast flank of the North El Vado Dome, which is a simple elliptical dome about 1.5 miles in diameter. The dome has relatively little deformation, with a few small faults and radial concentric joints. Many of the joints are slackensided, but seldom show an offset of bedding planes. At the damsite, the joints strike N-S at a few inches to one foot apart (radial joints) and strike E-W at about 50 to 100 feet apart (concentric joints). Some of the joints are open 1/8 to Â¼ inch in sandstone beds, but are tight in shale beds. Two normal faults are present 500 to 1000 feet upstream of the dam; one strikes E-W, about 2 miles long, with displacement varying from 2 to 50 feet and the other strikes N-S, about 1.1 miles long and has displacement of up to 75 feet. At the damsite, Willow creek has eroded its canyon through the Dakota formation (siliceous sandstone and carbonaceous shale) and into the upper part of the Morrison formation (Jurassic fine to medium Clayey sandstone and sandy shale). The contact between the Dakota and Morrison formations was found at elevation 6958 in the right abutment and elevation 6948 in the left abutment. The Morrison sandstone and shale comprising the dam foundation were described as fine to medium grained, clayey, firm to moderately hard, friable, jointed, brown, green and gray (for the shale).

dam_176,Jordanelle Dam,"Jordanelle Dam and Reservoir, located on the Provo River about 6 miles north of Heber City, provides water storage at an upstream site by exchange for Bonneville Unit water in Utah Lake and Strawberry Reservoir and for most of the water presently regulated in 15 small reservoirs on the headwaters of the Provo River. The reservoir functions as a long term holdover reservoirtoprovide storage through asix year drought period. Jordanelle has a capacity of 320,300 acre-feet with a surface area of 3,068 acres. The municipal and industrial water stored in Jordanelle Reservoir is delivered to Salt Lake County by way of the Provo River and Jordan Aqueduct, and to northern Utah County by way of the Provo River and Alpine Aqueduct. Geology The design data for Jordanelle Dam was reviewed by three independent panels of internationally recognized earth science authorities who concluded that a dam the size of Jordanelle could be safely constructed at the selected site. In addition, the combined United States and Utah Congressional Delegation conducted an in-depth investigation and declared Jordanelle Dam to be geologically sound.The dam is designed to withstand an earthquake of Richter scale magnitude 7.5 on the Wasatch Fault (19 miles west of the damsite), and magnitude 6.5 for a local random earthquake directly below the dam.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=176
dam_135,Kachess Dam,"Kachess Dam is an earthfill structure located on the Kachess River about 2 miles northwest of Easton. This dam, 115 feet high with a volume of 200,000 cubic yards, was built at the lower end of a natural lake, and created a reservoir with an active capacity of 239,000 acre-feet constructed over a natural lake having unknown dead storage capacity. The discharge channel for Kachess Reservoir is 2,877 feet long and was constructed from the natural lake to the intake structure of the dam’s outlet works. This was done so the natural lake could be used for storage. The first 1,182 feet consists of an open cut inlet channel leading to a 9 foot diameter tunnel for 1,393 feet and then 302 feet of open channel to the intake structure. Significant siltation has occurred in the discharge channel causing a restriction in passing the necessary water downstream. In 1996, sediment was removed from the inlet channel and a new channel was excavated along the existing tunnel. In addition, a new intake structure was constructed, the steel bridge from the dam to the intake structure replaced, and the outlet works conduit lined with a minimum of 4-inch thick reinforced concrete overlay. The channel improvements were accomplished under Phase II of the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project; Title XII of the Act of October 31, 1994. The intake structure and outlet conduit work was done as a part of the Bureau of Reclamation’s Operations and Maintenance Modifications Program. Geology A glacial till moraine extends across the entire Kachess River valley and comprises the foundation and abutments of the dam. The glacial till is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, cobbles, and boulders. These materials were used as the borrow for construction of the impervious and pervious zones of the dam.Preconstruction investigations suggest the thickness of the moraine ranges from 45 to 60 feet between dam stations 8+00 and 13+20. From dam station 13+20 to the left end of the dam at station 14+00, the moraine thickens rapidly to about 100 feet. The thickness of the moraine between dam stations 0+00 and 8+00 probably ranges from about 80 to 100 feet, and possibly up to 200 feet, based on the site topography and depth of the reservoir. Site investigations during original construction showed the moraine in the foundation and borrow areas to be comprised of lenses of fine materials (blue, brown, and gray clays), hardpan (fines, sand, gravel, and plus 3-inch material variably cemented with calcareous or iron-based agents), and various uncemented combinations and gradations of sand, gravel and plus 3-inch material.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=135
dam_294,Keechelus Dam,"Keechelus Dam was constructed at the lower end of a natural lake and is on the Yakima River, 10 miles northwest of Easton. This earthfill structure, completed in 1917, is 128 feet high and contains 684,000 cubic yards of material. Keechelus Lake has an active capacity of 157,900 acre-feet constructed over a natural lake having unknown dead storage capacity. Total rehabilitation of the outlet works and control tower was started in 1976. The two original cylinder gates were replaced by a single 8.5-foot-square hydraulically operated slide gate, and a new concrete chute and stilling basin that is 156 feet long, 18 feet wide, up to 28 feet deep were constructed. The concrete outlet conduit was partially lined with reinforced concrete, and a 22-inch-diameter pipe was installed in the outlet conduit to bypass minimum flows for fishery and stream enhancement when the outlet gates are closed. In mid-1998, it was determined that dam safety deficiencies existed at Keechelus Dam due to the potential for dam failure from piping and/or internal erosion of embankment materials. A reservoir operating restriction to elevation 2510 feet was imposed together with increased monitoring and surveillance pending implementation of corrective actions. This operating restriction limited storage to 140,920 acre-feet. Modifications were performed on the dam between April 2002 and November 2003 under Reclamation's Safety of Dams Program. Modifications included removing and rebuilding much of the dam cross-section to include embankment zones and drainage features, construction of a bentonite slurry cutoff wall in the right abutment, and construction of a downstream drain along the entire length of the dam-- all to control seepage and prevent internal erosion of the new structure. The reservoir operating restriction was lifted in early 2004. Geology Bedrock in the vicinity of the dam is rhyolite of the Naches Formation, which crops out on the left side of the spillway and provides the foundation for the spillway structure and the left abutment of the dam. Forming most of the foundation for the dam embankment are two Quaternary-age glacial units that extend across the Yakima River valley floor. The older and more extensive unit is Quaternary Glacial Drift, deposited in a terminal moraine to unknown depths. Quaternary Outwash Sediments overlie a portion of the glacial drift and form the shallow foundation of the dam to the right of station 44+00, to a maximum known thickness of 42 feet. Both units are generally dense, as indicated by the majority of standard penetration test (SPT) blowcounts and crosshole shear wave velocities.Differentiation between the two units is principally based on percentage of gravel and oversize materials (which is higher in the glacial drift), and on density (indicated by field hand test, blowcounts, and shear wave velocities). The glacial drift seems to have a very low permeability, leading to the assumption the extensive seepage seen downstream of the dam either passes through the outwash sediments, or along the contacts with either the embankment or the glacial drift.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=294
dam_295,Keene Creek Dam,"Keene Creek Dam is a 78-foot-high, 558-foot-long zoned earthfill embankment dam located 16 miles east of Ashland, Oregon, on Keene Creek. Behind the dam is the Keene Creek Reservoir with a total capacity of 390 acre-feet (active 260 acre-feet), which has sufficient water for the weekly cycle of powerplant operation for peaking power production of Green Springs Powerplant. The purpose of Keene Creek Dam is to reregulate releases from Howard Prairie and Hyatt Reservoirs to provide forebay pondage for Green Springs Powerplant. Geology The Keene Creek Dam and Reservoir are located in the Western Cascade geotectonic province of the Cascade Range on the West Side of that volcanic mountain belt. The project is in the easternmost part of the Western Cascades, which is characterized lithologically by slightly deformed and partly altered andesitic and bastalic lava flows and pyroclastic rocks of mid Tertiary age and physiographically by a deeply-eroded mature. Topography with deep canyons and fairly strong development of cuesta-type ridges expressive of the easterly dip of 10 to 20 degrees of the volcanic strata. This volcanic sequence has a thickness of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. Structurally it is complicated by intrusives and faulting and folding as well as the eastward tilting. Within one mile west of the project High Cascade geotectonic province forms the highest part of the Cascade Range. It is characterized by late Tertiary to Holocene volcanism, which is represented locally by the lower slopes of the Chinquapin Mountain. This volcano of probable Pleistocene age has a peak elevation of 6106 feet, is 2.5 miles northwest of the dam and lies several miles west of the main chain of volcanoes. Crater Lake which erupted about 6,000 years ago is 60 miles to the north. The closest Holocene volcanism is believed to have been at Mount Macloughlin, about 22 miles to the north. Pleistocene glaciation in the Cascade Range did not extend south of Mount Macloughlin, but the effects of wetter climate appears to be expressed in the deep weathering alteration of the volcanic bedrock, steep-sided valleys and landslides in the Western Cascades.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=295

The Fort Hays overlies the Carlile shale, which forms the bedrock under valley section of the Dam. Both of these formations are of Cretaceous Age. The overburden in the area consists of reworked chalk covered with a thin layer of silt and sand (loess). Numerous areas of lithologic color change indicating that the chalk is near the surface substantiate the thinness of the silt-sand layer. Several seismic spreads were shot in such areas to verify this interpretation. An example of chalk is revealed by a group of light colored patches about 700 feet south of the channel on the right abutment.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=108

dam_142,Lahontan Dam,"Lahontan Dam and Reservoir are situated in the southern Carson Desert, a large intermountain basin in the northwestern portion of the Basin and Range geomorphic province. The dam embankment and spillways are founded almost entirely on Truckee Formation rocks and sediments at a point where the Carson River has incised a 120-foot-deep canyon into an isolated butte capped by 40 to 50 feet of Lahontan Lake sediments. The Late Miocene to Pliocene Truckee formation consists of sandstone, claystone, siltstone, conglomerate, hard sandy clay, tuffaceous sand, tuff and minor volcanic flows with most beds being 1.0 to 4.2 feet thick. Unconformably overlying this formation are the flat-lying, unconsolidated, lacustrine beds of the Pleistocene Lahontan Valley Group. These lacustrine beds typically range in composition from poorly graded and silty sands to silt and lean to fat clays. The only parts of the embankment founded on the Lahontan Valley Group are the far left and right ends of the embankment. On the right abutment the contact between the Lahontan Valley Group and the underlying Truckee Formation is projected beneath the right spillway at about station 12+20 and elevation 4139 feet (dam crest elevation is 4174.0 feet). On the left abutment, this contact is projected to cross the centerline of the dam at about station 4+12 and elevation 4120. An isolated minor occurrence of river alluvium was encountered at a depth of 123.8 feet in Drill Hole DH/P-8.8 drilled in the crest of the embankment at Station 8+80. Any alluvium under the embankment is considered to be discontinuous and limited based on preconstruction, construction, as-built, and later investigation information. The 1915 Final Construction Report stated that: ""The riverbed was cleaned to either rock or clay and all sand, gravel and loam excavated and wasted."" .Typically the Truckee Formation beds at the dam site dip to the northwest, but with dips ranging from 10 to 30 degrees. There are local changes in the dips and strikes which are generally attributed to nearby faults. For instance, outcrops immediately upstream and downstream of the right spillway chute contain beds which strike northeast and dip 27 to 43 degrees northwest. Indirect evidence indicates two faults are present in the foundation of Lahontan Dam. The first fault, termed the Channel Fault, is believed to be present in the right portion of the Carson River channel, thus striking transversely under the dam at its maximum section. The fault strikes about N 35-45oE and dips about 70oSE. The presence of a spring and nearby artesian well along the trace of this fault prior to construction suggest groundwater moves along this fault. The second fault, termed the Right Abutment Fault, shows up as a strong lineament, over 400 feet long, to the right and downstream of the right spillway chute. This apparent fault strikes N 20-37o E, dips 70o southeast and is also a groundwater conduit as evidenced by clear water springs along its farthest downstream trace (about 700 to 800 feet downstream of the dam axis). These faults are not considered to be active (see Section I.G, Earthquake Loading).",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=142

The dam embankment has a maximum base width of 1,170 feet, a crest width of 30 feet, and contains a volume of 3,042,000 cubic yards of earth and rock materials. The spillway is on the right abutment of the dam and consists of an approach channel, concrete inlet structure, concrete ogee crest section, open concrete chute, concrete stilling basin, and outlet channel discharging into the Florida River. The design capacity of the spillway is 9,600 cubic feet per second. The outlet works is also in the right abutment of the dam and consists of an approach channel, a concrete intake structure, and a concrete-lined tunnel gate chamber for two 2.25-foot-square high pressure gates. The 9-foot horseshoe-shaped tunnel has a design capacity of 910 cubic feet per second. Lemon Reservoir is approximately 0.5 mile wide and 3 miles long with a surface area of 622 acres. The total capacity is 40,146 acre-feet, of which 39,030 acre-feet are active conservation. Geology Lemon Dam is constructed on bedrock of the Cutler Formation (Lower Perian) consisting of red to gray calcareous siltstone, shale and sandstone with interbedded limestone. The bedrock is highly fractured and fissile and the shale interbeds readily slack when exposed to air. The dip of the bedrock beneath the dam is approximately 10 degrees to the south. Reconstruction drill hole data indicates that some of the limestone intererbeds contain solution channels. Foundation treatment consisted of a grout curtain, with a minimum depth of 160 feet across the valley floor and up both abutments, and a cutoff trench (1.5:1 side slopes) within the limits of the Zone 1 core and extending 5 feet into bedrock or to a minimum base depth of 30 feet. The trench was excavated to a 10-foot width in siltstone below the old river channel at elevation 7,883. The reservoir is in a narrow valley that is approximately half a mile wide and three miles long. It has a maximum storage capacity of 40,146 acre-feet with a surface area of 622 acres at a water surface elevation of 8,148 feet. The reservoir appears to be watertight since the siltstone and shale bedrock and randomly sorted glacial till are relatively impervious. Several northwesterly trending normal faults, downdropped to the north have been identified around the edge of the reservoir.

The completed structure has a structural height of 129 feet high, with a zoned earthfill embankment containing about 959,000 cubic yards of material. Outlet works reconstruction included enlargement of the entrance channel to the existing intake structure, construction of a gate chamber with a connecting 6-foot-diameter access shaft and shaft house in the existing tunnel approximately 250 feet downstream from the intake structure, extension of the existing tunnel with a 150-foot-long, 6- by 8-foot conduit and a 60-foot-long, 6- by 10-foot chute, and excavation of a stilling basin in the outlet channel. The spillway consists of an inlet channel, a concrete spillway structure with uncontrolled crest, an outlet channel, and a training wall on the right side of the outlet channel beginning approximately 1,000 feet downstream from the spillway crest. A one-unit, 3,000 kilowatt powerplant was placed in operation in 1985 at the Little Wood River Dam by the Little Wood River Irrigation District pursuant to its license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Geology The principal physiographic features of the region are the broad plain of the Snake River and the bordering foothills which merge into the rugged high mountain masses of central Idaho. At lower elevations, vegetative cover is predominately sagebrush and native grasses. At higher elevations trees appear singly or in scattered groups, but not as continuous forest.Sedimentary rocks, which range in age from very old to moderately young, are found at higher elevations. Younger rocks, volcanic in origin, appear along the border of the mountains and the plain. During geologically recent time, intracanyon basalt flows have covered the valley floor and they are the youngest formations. The present stream has eroded a deep channel through these formations. In the vicinity of the reservoir, the river flows along the contact of the intracanyon basalts and the older volcanic rocks. Downstream from the reservoir the stream has eroded through the basalt flows into the older stream gravel. Little Wood River Reservoir and the stream flows across an alluvial fan onto the Snake River basalts. Project lands occupy this alluvial fan of Little Wood River's which underlies the basalt.

dam_120,Lower Yellowstone Diversion Dam,"The Lower Yellowstone Diversion Dam is a 700-feet long timber and stone-filled structure that spans the Yellowstone River and diverts water into the headworks of the Lower Yellowstone Project’s Main Canal. The crest of the wooden crib structure is approximate elevation of 1,989 feet, and an additional 1-2 feet of rock are periodically placed on top to an elevation of 1,991. The weir creates adequate water surface elevation to facilitate irrigation water diversions. A cableway system is used to replace rock at the weir as needed to maintain sufficient elevation for diversion into the Main Canal headworks. Water is diverted from the Yellowstone River into the Main Canal by the Lower Yellowstone Diversion Dam near Intake, Montana. It is carried by gravity to the greater portion of the project lands. About 2,300 acres of bench-land are irrigated by water pumped from the canal by the Thomas Point Pumping Plant. There are three pumping plants on the project; one at Thomas Point on the Main Canal, one at Crane on the Main Canal, and one on Drain 27. The Thomas Point Pumping Plant is on the Main Canal about 19 miles below the headworks. The plant has two units directly connected to hydraulic turbines and one motor-driven unit. The energy derived from 80 cubic feet per second of water falling 28 feet from the Main Canal to Lateral KK is utilized by the two hydraulic turbine driven centrifugal pumps to lift 45 cubic feet per second of water 31 feet to Lateral LL for irrigation of 2,300 acres of benchland north of Savage, Montana. The motor driven unit pumps 20 cubic feet per second of water from the Main Canal into Lateral LL. The Crane Pumping Plant has two motor-driven units, each of which pumps 5 cubic feet per second of water from the Main Canal into Lateral BP-1. The pumping plant at Drain 27 has one motor-driven unit which pumps 15 cubic feet per second of water from the drain into Lateral N. Main Canal and Distribution System The Main Canal diverts to the west side of the Yellowstone River at Intake and extends down the valley to the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers.

dam_126,Mann Creek Dam,"Mann Creek Dam, on Mann Creek about 13 miles northeast of Weiser, Idaho, is a zoned earth and rockfill structure with a crest length of 1,176 feet and height of 148 feet above bedrock. The crest width of 30 feet with guardrails along each shoulder provides a crossing for the relocated Monroe Creek road. A reinforced concrete morning-glory spillway inlet that connects to a reinforced concrete conduit, 11 feet in diameter, terminates in a concrete stilling basin located along the right abutment. The outlet works, located along the left abutment, is also of reinforced concrete. The flow of water is controlled by two 2.25-foot-square high-pressure gates located in the control house and one 2.75-foot-square high-pressure gate located in the gate chamber for emergencies. Mann Creek Reservoir, at the normal water surface elevation of 2,889.0 feet, is 1.8 miles long, has a surface area of 283 acres, and at closure had a total capacity of 13,000 acre-feet (active 11,100 acre-feet). There are separate outlets that branch off the main outlet works pipe to supply water to the Joslyn Ditch and the Mann Creek Ditch. A 1992 sedimentation survey estimated that Mann Creek Reservoir now has a total capacity of 12,500 acre-feet (active 10,900 acre-feet). Geology The construction which forms the dam is due to the presence of a succession of basaltic flows, ash lenses, and layers of bentonitic tuff. The basalt flows are considerably harder and more durable than the lake sediments which are found along the valley both upstream and downstream from the damsite. They vary in thickness from 3 feet to 40 feet, dip very slightly downstream, and are composed of dark, fine-grained, dense, fresh, hard basalt. Contacts between the flows are generally well-bonded and quite impermeable. The volcanic tuff, although it has a tendency to slack and swell slightly upon exposure to air and water, is moderately hard and very impermeable in place.Along the valley floor at the dam, bedrock is concealed by stream deposits varying in thickness from 4-1/2 feet to 14 feet. The overburden consists of a mixture of silt, sand, gravel, and boulders. With depth, the boulders become dominant; several of them are 18 inches to 24 inches in diameter. Most of the over burden is fairly permeable.The abutments are covered by an irregular mantel of soil and talus, varying in depth from a few inches to possibly 35 feet, consisting of a compact mixture of large basalt blocks, small angular fragments, and clayey silt.Bedrock in the dam and reservoir area is the Payette formation, an enormously thick series of lakebeds and intercalated volcanic products consisting of basalt, volcanic ash, and tuff. The lakebeds, making up most of the reservoir floor and sides, are thin-bedded, semi consolidated silts, clays, limestones, marls, diatomaceous earth, and sandstones. They are extremely water tight and water losses from the reservoir should be negligible.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=126

dam_164,Merritt Dam,"Merritt Dam and Reservoir and the Snake River drainage basin are located within the northern portion of the Sandhills Region of Nebraska. The topography of this area is one of rough hills and hummocks, composed of fine, wind-blown sand, resting on low rolling plains. Occasional valleys, which are generally broad and shallow, and areas of low relief create breaks in the dune topography. In the lower reaches, the valleys often become narrow and deeply entrenched. Merritt Dam and Reservoir are built on the Snake River where the valley narrows and becomes entrenched. Maximum relief within the Snake River drainage basin is less than 200 feet. The continental sediments representing the Tertiary system at the damsite are of the Pliocene Series (upper Tertiary). The dam is built mostly within and on the Ogallala beds of Pliocene age. The Ogallala beds lie unconformably on the Brule formation of the Oligocene series. The Brule formation is a massive, light-colored siltstone. It is considered impervious and the top of the Brule is regarded as the base of the possible seepage zones. The Ogallala Group is represented by two formations, the Ash Hollow and the Valentine. The Ash Hollow formation is exposed at the damsite and is composed of stratified sand, silt, volcanic ash, and clay, which occur alone and as mixtures. The material is non- to well-cemented by lime. The Valentine formation consists of compact, fine, greenish-brown sand and silts. This formation was not encountered during construction as it occurs considerably below the stream bed. The sand dunes and limited amount of sediments in the small flood plain are of Recent or Pleistocene age. Both the sand dunes and flood plain sediments are silty, fine sands. The sand dunes are wind deposited and the flood plain sediments are reworked sand dunes. The Snake River valley at the damsite is asymmetric, having the most recent stream location entrenched next to the left abutment.

dam_181,Minidoka Dam,"Minidoka Powerplant and Dam is a combined diversion, storage, and power structure located just south of Minidoka, Idaho. A key structure in the initial development of the project, the zoned earthfill dam is 86 feet high. The reservoir, Lake Walcott, has a total storage capacity of95,200 acre-feet. During the irrigation season,water is diverted at the dam into a canal on each side of the river. The original powerplant was constructed within the concrete buttress section of the dam, located at the right end of the rockfill section, was completed in 1909 and had five generating units. Unit 6 was added in 1927 and unit 7 in 1942 to provide a total capacity of 13,400 kilowatts. During 1989 - 1990, the spillway radial gates were replaced. The original gates were installed in 1913 and were in need of complete replacement. Construction was completed in 1997 at the Allen E. Inman Powerplant. Intended to replace the retired units (1-5) and utilize more of the excess flows previously spilled, this powerplant houses two 10-megawatt horizontal shaft Kaplan Units. The combined generation capacity of all four units is 28.5 megawatts, with a combined flow of 8670 cubic feet per second. Minidoka Dam was originally designed and constructed without a powerplant and was completed in 1907. The powerplant (and three pumping plants) was added later (1909-1910) to allow water to be delivered to lands which could not be fed by gravity irrigation. The concrete buttress section of the dam forms the upstream structure of the original powerplant. The powerplant could only use a fraction of the water that passed through the dam, so Unit 6 was added in 1927 to allow commercial sales of power in excess of project needs. Unit 7 was added in 1942 to help feed the public`s growing thirst for electric power. In September 1995, the five original units were retired and Units 6 and 7 were rebuilt. Units 8 and 9 were added in 1997 at Minidoka Dam with the building of the Minidoka Replacement (now Allen E. Inman) Powerplant. The original powerplant building continues to house units 6 and 7.

dam_200,Mountain Park Dam,"The foundation of Mountain Park Dam consists of Cambrian granite which has been intruded by diabase. The granite is hard, fine to medium rystalline, pink to grayish pink, and weathered to a depth of about 2 inches along joints near the surface. It is intricately cut by joints, shear, and faults.The canyon in which the dam is constructed is fault and joint controlled. A fault zone approximately 62 feet wide is present in the canyon floor and lies beneath the central portion of the dam. This zone is characterized by sheared, pulverized, granular, slickensided diabase with some granite between the diabase intrusions. The granite in this zone is hard to soft and easily broken. The zone, known as the plug area, was over excavated to a depth of 25 feet, backfilled with concrete, and then grouted. Other areas of soft rock in the abutments and foundation area were also over excavated to a minimum depth of 5 feet, then backfilled with concrete. The foundation area and abutments were grouted before placing concrete. Mountain Park Dam forms Tom Steed Reservoir, and regulates natural flows of West Otter Creek and diverted flows from Elk Creek to provide municipal and industiral water supplies for the cities of Altus, Snyder, and Frederick, Oklahoma.

dam_228,North Dam,"North Dam is located2 miles southwest of Grand Coulee Dam. North and Dry Falls Dams, two rock-faced, earthfill dams at the north and south ends of the Ice-Age channel of the Columbia River, now known as the Grand Coulee, form Banks Lake, the equalizing reservoir. This 27-mile-long reservoir, with an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet, feeds Columbia River water into the Main Canal. In addition, it provides water on a return flow basis to produce power when the pump-generating units are operating in the generating mode. Major features forming and serving Banks Lake are the feeder canal with a capacity of 26,000 cfs, North Dam, 2 miles southwest of Grand Coulee Dam, and Dry Falls Dam and Main Canal headworks near Coulee City, 29 miles south of Grand Coulee Dam. Geology North Dam is located on the northern edge of the area underlain by the Columbia Plateau lava.The structure is in the center of a deep, relatively flat bottomed, steep-walled canyon about 1.6 km downstream from the Columbia River gorge. Basalt flows and interbedded Latah beds underlie the northern part of the dam. The Latah is a lake deposit of clayey to sandy sediment that developed along the margin of the basalt. In the area where the southern part of the dam is located, granite and metasediments of the basement rock formation come to the surface.In the deepest part of the canyon excavation, alluvial deposits of silt, sand, and gravel as well as Lake Beds of Nespelem silt and sand cover the older rocks. Surface deposits of swamp muck and blow sand form a thin surface mantle.At the north end of the dam an isolated block of basalt rises above crest elevation.This basalt, together with a considerable amount of clay and sandstone of the Latah Formation, is interpreted in the exploration reports as slide material. The movement is believed to have taken place near the end of the canyon cutting cycle during the ice age. No movement of the block or surrounding material has been noted during construction or operation of the dam. In the north part of the dam excavation, the trench reached basalt of Latah beds.In some places these materials were in place and in others classified as ""disturbed"" material.Both types seemed suitable for a dam foundation.On the south end the trench was carried down to granite.The rock surface was irregular and the depth of the cut varied from place to place.The resulting foundation was satisfactory. Between these two areas the recent alluvial fill was deep and a layer of materials such as gravel and Nespelem lake beds was left beneath the outer zones of the dam.Such materials as swamp muck or blow sand were entirely removed.This formed a stable foundation and no excessive settlement or movement has been recorded.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=228

dam_248,Ochoco Dam,"Ochoco Dam, a hydraulic-fill structure on Ochoco Creek 6 miles east of Prineville, was constructed immediately after World War I as a part of the Veterans Farm Settlement Program undertaken by the State of Oregon. The left abutment is an alluvial fan, and the right abutment is a slide mass consisting of fine earth and rock. The original dam was about 126 feet high and 1,000 feet long, with an average crest width of 15 feet. The dam leaked badly through the main section, with heavy leakage at or through the right abutment. Since the dam was a constant hazard to life and property in the valley and the city of Prineville, some rehabilitation was required. The dam was rehabilitated by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1949 and the reservoir capacity was increased at that time. The dam provides flood control of Ochoco Creek in addition to storing water for irrigation. As repaired and reconstructed by the Bureau of Reclamation, the dam is 152 feet high with a crest length of 1,300 feet. The spillway is an open concrete chute at the south end of the dam. Geology Landslide (Qls) - This unit is a chaotic mixture of welded rhyolitic blocks up to 20 feet in diameter in a matrix of predominantly granular soil. It extends about one mile right and downstream of the centerline of the dam and several miles upstream. It has high permeability with repeated development of sinkholes along the reservoir shore. This unit is connected with most of the major seepage problems at the dam. It forms the right abutment of the dam and the foundation of the outlet works conduit. This unit contains a Basal Zone (Qlsb) with a significantly high proportion of clay fines and lower permeability. The Basal Zone is the failure surface upon which the landslide rides. Alluvial Fan/Talus Complex (Qaf) - This unit is a crudely stratified mixture of hard angular cobbles and boulders in a matrix of gravelly silt and clay. It is generally semipervious but can transmit significant seepage in some areas. It forms most of the foundation of the spillway and most of the left abutment of the dam. Slopewash (Qsw) - This unit is composed of local residual and accumulated deposits of angular cobbles and boulders with a matrix of gravel, sand, silt and clay on the left abutment. Alluvium (Qal) - This unit is composed of gravel and sand deposits of Ochoco Creek with some interbeds of silt and clay and occasional cobbles. The permeabilities range from about 200 to 7,000 ft/yr. Upper and lower zones form local aquifers with the lower zone being artesian to the upper zone.

dam_315,Owyhee Dam,"Owyhee Dam is a concrete, thick-arch structure which was designed to carry about three-fourths of the water load by arch action and the remainder by gravity action. The dam rises 417 feet above foundation in the river section, and 530 feet above the low point of the excavated fault zone. At the time of its construction, Owyhee ranked as the world's highest dam. The arch section is 623 feet long, and a gravity tangent extends 210 feet to the right abutment. The total capacity of Lake Owyhee is 1,120,000 acre-feet (active 715,000 acre-feet). Owyhee Dam became a proving ground for theories being developed to assist with the design and construction of Hoover Dam, whose unprecedented size - it would tower more than 300 feet higher than Owyhee - required totally new construction methods. The trial load method of design, developed first for Pathfinder and Buffalo Bill Dams, was refined in the design of Owyhee Dam and, later, Hoover Dam. Cooling methods, necessary to remove excess heat of cement hydration from mass concrete and bring a dam to stable temperatures, were carefully studied. A 28-foot-square section extending through the dam was cooled artificially by circulating river water through 1-inch pipes spaced at 4-foot intervals. Water for irrigation is diverted through a horseshoe-type tunnel 16 feet 7 inches in diameter and 3.5 miles long. This tunnel heads in the reservoir 80 feet below normal maximum water surface. The needle valves in the outlet works were replaced by the jet flow gates in 1991 as a part of an operation and maintenance modifications program. Geology Consists of massive rhyolite and associated pitchstone agglomerate and massive pitchstone. Foundation rock was considered slightly weathered to fresh, moderately hard, and intensely fractured to very intensely fractured. Of note, an 8- to 32-foot-wide zone of highly fractured rock was encountered during construction and was ""extensively"" treated.

dam_194,O`Sullivan Dam,"O'Sullivan Dam, one of the larger zoned earthfill dams in the United States, is on Crab Creek about 15 miles south of Moses Lake. The 27,800-acre Potholes Reservoir formed by this dam collects return flows from all irrigation in the upper portion of the project for reuse in the southern portion. Active storage capacity of the reservoir is 332,200 acre-feet. A system of wasteways has been built on both the West and East Low Canals to provide operational safety for the canals and a means of delivering water into Potholes Reservoir to supplement the natural and return flows Geology Bedrock in the area of O'Sullivan Dam consists principally of basalt flows and interflow zones of the same general type as encountered elsewhere in the Columbia basin project. Exposures of Ringold formation sediments occur in Lind Coulee to the east of the dam site area, but not within the actual foundation area of the dam. Overburden within the damsite area consists of a thin, discontinuous cover of windblown silt and sand which, together with sand and gravel, partially fills many of the potholes and channels cut into the basalt flows. Several of the channels in the southwesterly portion of the area contain deposits of sodium sulfate derived from the evaporation of the seasonal lakes. A predominant terrace of sand and gravel overlies the basalt and Ringold sediments to the north. Toward the northwest the surface of the reservoir area is covered by superficial deposits of sand gravel and windblown sand. Beneath these overburden materials are the Ringold sediments and the basalt flows. The basalt flows of the dam site area range from near horizontal to gently warped except for a narrow zone of disturbance known as the Lind Coulee Flexure. This zone was characterized by faulting and sharp folding, trends in a rather irregular fashion in a general east-west direction through the dam site area.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=194
dam_316,Pactola Dam,"Pactola Dam is situated at a point along Rapid Creek where the valley narrows and the creek has cut through a resistant, northwest trending ridge. Rocks at the dam consist of a complex series of schists, slates and amphibolites lying in nearly vertical beds which strike in a northwest direction. There is a small fold in the right abutment that modifies the strike of the beds and causes the axis of the dam to cross some beds twice. The schistosity for the most part parallels the original bedding. The amphibolite schist rocks are hard, jointed and usually weathered to shallow depths. The slate beds contain abundant iron pyrite which weathers readily above the water table.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=316
dam_317,Palisades Dam,"Palisades Dam is located on the Snake River about 55 miles southeast of Idaho Falls, Idaho. It is a large zoned earthfill structure 270 feet high, has a crest length of 2,100 feet, and contains 13,571,000 cubic yards of material. At the time of construction, this was the largest volume of material placed in a dam by the Bureau of Reclamation. The spillway is a 28-foot-diameter tunnel through the left abutment, with a capacity of 48,500 cubic feet per second. The outlet works and power inlet structures are controlled by a fixed-wheel gate at the entrances of the inclined shafts leading to 26-foot-diameter tunnels. The outlet tunnel conveys the water to the steel manifold transition section, where it is released to the stilling basin by regulating gates. At the lower end of the power tunnel, the water may be released to the stilling basin or to four penstocks and conveyed to the turbines for power generation. The capacity of the outlet works is 33,000 cubic feet per second. The dam creates a reservoir of 1,401,000 acre-feet capacity (active 1,200,000 acre-feet). The powerplant is on the downstream toe of the dam on the west side of the river and initially had a total capacity of 118,750 kilowatts. The powerplant was uprated in 1994 and all four units were rewound increasing the nameplate capacity to a total of 176,600 kilowatts; 44,150 kilowatts each. As part of the mitigation for the powerplant uprate, a fish screen was constructed on Palisades Creek, a small tributary which joins the Snake River approximately 3 miles downstream from the dam. Geology Palisades Reservoirs covers about 16,000 acres on the floor of the Grand Valley, the northern portion of Lower Star Valley. The floor of the reservoir is a relatively flat plain underlain by a veneer of silt and fine sand and layers of sands and gravels. The total thickness of the overburden throughout the valley ranges from 5 to about 60 feet. The sand and gravel portion of the overburden is quite pervious. The overburden along the valley walls consists mostly of talus, which has accumulated along the base of the steeper slopes, and of outwash deposits from the side canyons. The talus deposits are accumulated rock debris and clayey silt soil, which appears to be semimpervious materials. The overburden on the main valley floor is underlain by a series of highly compact, uncemented, clays, silts sands and gravels. Surface exposures are found only at a few cuts along the riverbanks. In general the beds are rather lenticular, their strike is parallel with the north-southwest trend of the valley and are rather tight. The left wall is underlain by steeply inclined, consolidated sediments which are much older than the clay-silt beds. The right wall of the valley rises as a very steep slope from the dam upstream for about 500 feet, then as a cliff for several hundred feet to the rim of the valley.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=317
dam_201,Palo Verde Diversion Dam,"Palo Verde Diversion Dam, located on the Colorado River 9 miles northeast of Blythe, California,is a semipervious barrier of sand, gravel, and rockfill, with a crest width of 20 feet, a length of 1,850 feet which includes the spillway, and a maximum height of 46 feet above the streambed. The embankment, consisting of two zones, contains 157,000 cubic yards of material. Both the upstream and downstream slopes of the embankment are 4:1 from crest elevation to riverbed. The upstream zone consists of sand, gravel, and cobble fill, which is protected with 24 inches of riprap to elevation 20.0 feet. The downstream zone is rockfill taken from structure excavation and quarry. The spillway control structure is founded on rock at the right abutment of the dam. It is a gated structure consisting of three 50-foot bays, separated by two 8-foot-thick intermediate piers. The piers and gravity wall abutments support a bridge structure on which is mounted the hoist for operating the spillway radial gates. The headworks structure is designed to direct 1,800 cubic feet per second from the river into the settling basin of the Palo Verde Irrigation District canal system with diversion water at elevation 283.5 feet. The structure includes four 12- by 8-foot conduit barrels with a downstream transition and training channel. A control house is located immediately upstream of the headworks. In it are housed the panels for the power distribution and control system, forebay stilling wells and probe units, emergency power units, and recording equipment. Emergency power is supplied by a 30-kilowatt, 230-volt, 3-phase, 60-hertz gas engine generator set for use during failure of the local power supply. The 30-mile levee system is divided into the Lower Arizona Levee, Upper Arizona Levee, and the California Levee. At the request of the Tribal Council of the Colorado River Indian Reservation at Parker, Arizona., the levees were located about 1,300 feet from the river channel so the shoreline would not be encroached upon and would, in the future, be made available for recreation development. The tops of the levees were surfaced with 6 inches of selected gravel to provide a roadway for maintenance purposes and access to various points on the river. The design flood for the levees is 75,000 cubic feet per second. The levees are provided with a 20-foot top, land-side slope of 1.5:1, river-side slope of 2:1, and 4 feet of freeboard. The amount of riprap placed varies within different sections of the levees. A 21-mile-long intercepting drain was constructed parallel to and 300 feet from the landward side of the lower levee; the outfall is downstream of the dam. The drain was designed for a capacity of 30 cubic feet per second at the upstream end, increasing to 128 cubic feet per second at the outfall below the dam. The Palo Verde Diversion Dam and diversion works were turned over to the Palo Verde Irrigation District for operation and maintenance on December 17, 1957. Operation and maintenance of the levees and drain were transferred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs on August 20, 1958.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=201

The capacity of the outlet works is 1,250 cubic feet per second at maximum water surface elevation. The spillway, also on the right abutment, consists of an uncontrolled ogee crest and open chute having a design capacity of 12,500 cubic feet per second. The chute joins the combined outlet works-spillway stilling basin. Paonia Reservoir has a surface area of 334 acres with a total capacity of 20,950 acre-feet and an active capacity of 18,150 acre-feet. Geology The damsite is located in a narrow V-notch section of Muddy Creek. On the right abutment, a thin mantle of soil blankets the Mesaverde formation. There are outcrop exposures of sandstone along this abutment about 60 feet above the stream. Accumulation of slope wash was found along the base of this abutment. This soil is generally sandy in texture with some fragments of sandstone distributed throughout. These fragments of sandstone vary in size from one foot to five feet in diameter. The left abutment of the dam is a steep North Slope covered with a mantle of sandy boulder soil. The depth of overburden on both abutments varies considerably and is influenced by alternating beds of sandstone and shales. The overburden blanketing the sandstone lenses is very shallow; the depth of overburden over the shale is deeper. The stream channel is made up of lava and granitic cobbles and boulders intermixed with the stream gravels. Slope wash and out wash fan accumulations have crowded into the channel. The depth of the channel gravel varies from 10 to 19 feet below the elevation of the stream surface through the damsite area. The stream has done some undercutting especially along the base of the left abutment and caused the slumping of the slope wash diverting the channel back to the right abutment.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=203

dam_207,Parker Dam,"Parker Dam is a concrete arch structure commonly called the 'deepest dam in the world'.  Seventy-three percent of the dam's structural height of 320 feet is below the original river bed; only about 85 feet of the dam's strucural height is visible (its superstructure rises another 62 feet above the roadway across the top of the dam). Parker Dam has a volume of 380,000 cubic yards of concrete. At its crest, the dam is 856 feet long. Water control is provided by five 50-ft-square gates. Lake Havasu backs up behind the dam for 45 miles and covers more than 20,400 acres (32 square miles). The reservoir's total capacity is 646,200 acre-feet. The Metropolitan Water District`s W. P. Whitsett Intake Pumping Plant for the Colorado River Aqueduct is located on the shore of Lake Havasu about two miles upstream from the dam. The aqueduct begins at the intake pumping plant and extends 242 miles to its terminus at Lake Mathews near Riverside, California. About half of the power generated at Parker Dam is reserved by MWD to pump Colorado River water along the Colorado River Aqueduct. The remaining power is marketed to users in California, Nevada and Arizona by the Western Area Power Administration. By contract, the use of active storage in Lake Havasu to generate power is limited to the elevation between 440 to 450 feet. The Parker Powerplant includes a penstock gate structure, four penstock tunnels, and a powerplant building housing four hydroelectric generating units. Each of the four tunnels and penstocks conveying river water from the forebay at the left end of the dam to the turbines is 22 feet in diameter and has a water capacity of 5,575 cubic feet per second.

dam_218,Pineview Dam,"Pineview Dam is located in the Ogden River Canyon about 7 miles east of Ogden, Utah. The dam is a zoned earthfill structure. It was originally constructed to a structural height of 103 feet, forming a reservoir of 44,175 acre-feet capacity. The capacity of the reservoir was later enlarged to 110,150 acre-feet by increasing the structural height of the dam to 137 feet as a part of the Weber Basin Project. The overflow, channel-type spillway, controlled by radial gates, has a capacity of 10,000 cubic feet per second. The crest of the dam, elevation 4,908.0 feet, is 30 feet wide, 600 feet long, and contains a total volume of 410,000 cubic yards of earth, rock, and riprap material. The overflow, channel-type spillway, controlled by radial gates, has a capacity of 10,000 cfs. A 2,300 cubic foot per second capacity outlet works is located in a tunnel in the right abutment. It consists of a 72 inch pipe which leads into the 75 inch Ogden Canyon Conduit, and a 60 inch pipe which discharges into the spillway stilling basin. The 72 inch pipe has a wye which permits additional discharges into the stilling basin, and the 60 inch line has a 42 inch pipe connected to it to allow water to be delivered to the Ogden City filtration plant located downstream from the dam. Water from the dam is transported 4.7 miles through the Ogden Canyon Conduit, jointly owned by the Ogden River Water Users Association and Utah Power & Light Company, to the two canals for distribution. Water for the South Ogden Highline Canal is conveyed across the canyon in a 360 foot long, 36 inch diameter steel siphon suspended from the canyon wall. The South Ogden Highline Canal has an initial capacity of 35 cubic feet per second and extends south 5.2 miles from the intersection. It is a gravity pressure distribution system, constructed for the delivery of water under gravity pressure and on demand from the South Ogden Highline Canal.

dam_319,Pishkun Dikes,"Pishkun Reservoir and enclosing dikes are founded on glacial deposits (till) of an outwash plain lying east of the Sawtooth Mountains. The thickness and character of glacial till vary widely over short distances. Till was deposited by advancing ice and runoff fed by melting alpine glacier. The thickness range is suggested by the hummocky topography characterized by rounded hills and undrained or poorly drained depressions. The landscape just west of Pishkun Reservoir is dotted with small lakes and is generally poor drainage. The reservoir and dikes are at the eastern margin of the glacial outwash plain. Locally, erosion has cut through glacial deposits exposing shale and sandy shale of the Two Medicine formation. The thickness range of glacial deposits under and around the reservoir is not well known but may range up to 100 feet. Pishkun Reservoir is an offstream storage reservoir, about 15 miles northeast of Gibson Dam, and has a capaicity of 46,700 acre-feet. The reservoir is part of the Sun River Project and is formed by eight earthfill dikes with heights ranging from 12 to 50 feet with an overall length of 9,050 feet. The outlet for the reservoir is a 12-foot-diameter, approximately semi-circular, concrete conduit through Dike No. 4. The outlet structure has a maximum capacity of 1,600 cubic feet per second.

It is an earthfill structure consisting of a main embankment and a dike section, separated by a rock knoll in which the spillway is excavated. The maximum embankment height is 165 feet, and the dam contains 909,884 cubic yards of material. The reservoir formed by the dam has a capacity of 59,570 acre-feet, 6,060 acre-feet of which are for flood control and 53,510 acre-feet for joint use. The spillway is an open rock cut with a concrete control section having a capacity of 3,000 cubic feet per second. The outlet works, with a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet per second, is located in the right abutment. Geology Platoro Dam and Reservoir are located in a geologic area consisting of a complex volcanic bedrock material of, andesite, latite and related rock materials such as breccias and agglomerates. In addition, a unique basaltic material and occasional intrusions are found in the area. Land and rockslides of great magnitude dominate surficial geology. There are two large fault zones that cross the basin at right angles, one about one-half mile upstream and the other about 3 miles upstream. There are, however, three distinct shear zones within the dam and dike foundation area. The damsite bedrock is severely fractured and contains localized shear zones. Some of the shear zones contain highly stained or mineralized vein like material. Exploration indicated the fractures were healed at depth and those that were opened were generally clean and free of mud or other material.

dam_243,Rattlesnake Dam,"Rattlesnake Dam lies in an erosional gap cut by Rattlesnake Creek. This creek drains a synclinal depression cutting into the Precambrian core. Compressional stresses and mountain uplift have developed folding and minor faulting at the site. Schistose foliations within exposed rock strikes generally east-west across the regional mountain axis. Exposed rock at the site consists of Precambrian schist, gneiss, and granite-gneiss. The schist is hard, micaceous gray material that is soft and decomposed at the surface. The gneiss and granite-gneiss are hard, grey material, sometimes altered and broken. The dam was built on mostly schistose-gneiss of the Precambrian Idaho Springs Formation. This rock is generally grey to light gray, medium to fine grained, fractured, and thinly to very thinly foliated. Near the ground surface the rock is weathered and decomposed. Decomposed rock is soft, while harder sound rock occurs at increased depth. Weathering and decomposition may be on the order of several tens of feet. Overlying the bedrock are alluvium and colluvium associated with the present day Rattlesnake Creek erosion. Average depth of these materials is about ten feet. These materials transition in depth and gradation towards outcrops on the surrounding hills. Alluvium generally consists of sands and gravels with a few cobbles and boulders residing in the stream bed area. Colluvium consists of similar materials, but more towards the cobbles and boulders gradation, that are wasting downslope from the hill sides.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=243

dam_250,Red Fleet Dam,"Red Fleet Dam and Reservoir are constructed on Big Brush Creek about 3.5 miles downstream from the crossing of State Highway 44 and about 10 miles northeast of Vernal, Utah. The dam is zoned earthfill with a structural height of 144 feet above the bed of Big Brush Creek. The crest length is 1,670 feet long and 30 feet wide. Red Fleet Reservoir has a total capacity of 26,000 acre-feet, of which 24,000 acre-feet is active storage. The reservoir has a surface area of 521 acres at the normal water surface elevation of 5,608.2 feet. Geology Red Fleet Dam and Reservoir are located on the south flank of the Uinta Mountains in the unglaciated valley of Big Brush Creek, a tributary of the Green River. The stream begins near the crest of the range and flows in a southwest direction to the Green River. The oldest rocks exposed in the drainage area are Precambrian age and occur in the headwaters of the basin. Successively younger rocks crop out down the river valley. These rocks form a thick layer of roughly parallel sedimentary beds as young as mid-Cretaceous in age. Initially, they formed a horizontal layer overlying a relatively flat erosion surface on Precambrian age. Following the uplift in late Cretaceous time, they formed an anticline over a core of Precambrian rock. Erosion removed the cover over the crest of the fold and the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks now occur on the flanks of the range as a succession of outward dipping beds. Rock formations of Mesozoic age underlie the reservoir, while the damsite is underlain only by rocks of Cretaceous age. Further downstream, Tertiary age sediments, deposited after the older beds were folded, blanket the Unita Basin floor and cover many of the interstream areas on the mountain slope. These rocks occur in relatively horizontal layers and in many places lap up on the eroded edges of the older sediments.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=250
dam_189,Red Willow Creek Diversion Dam,"Red Willow Creek Diversion Dam, located on Red Willow Creek about 6 miles northwest of Indianola, is a concrete baffled apron weir with earth embankments at both ends.

dam_321,Red Willow Dam,"Red Willow Dam, located on Red Willow Creek about 10 miles northwest of McCook, is an earthfill embankment with a structural height of 126 feet that forms a reservoir of 86,630 acre-feet. An ungated concrete spillway is located in the right abutment. An outlet works through the base of the dam provides for river and irrigation releases for downstream diversions. The reservoir behind this dam is Hugh Butler Lake. Lying beneath the dam and abutments is the Ash Hollow member of the Ogallala Formation (To), a Mio-Pliocene nonmarine deposit of variably cemented sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The Ogallala is a major aquifer in the area. Overlying the Ogallala at the abutments are discontinuous beds of Pleistocene Crete Sand (Qcf), which fill shallow paleochannels on top of the Ogallala Formation. (Though detected only during investigations of the left abutment, it is assumed that the Crete Sand is intermittently present at both abutments.) Pleistocene Loveland and Peorian loess (Ql), consisting of silt and fine sand, rest on top of Crete Formation and form the upper part of the abutments. The foundation of the dam consists of approximately 40 feet of alluvium (Qu and Qal) deposited in the old Red Willow Creek channel on top of the Ogallala Formation. Beneath the Ogallala Formation, at a depth of approximately 120 to 130 feet, is Pierre Shale. A considerable portion of the alluvium consists of saturated, well-sorted sand which may be potentially liquefiable. The upper alluvial zone (Qu) is described as alluvial silt and has much lower horizontal and vertical permeability than the alluvial silty sand (Qal) zone that lies below it. The spillway and outlet works, located in the right abutment of the dam, are both founded on the Ogallala Formation. Excavation for the outlet works was primarily within the Ogallala Formation, whereas excavation for the spillway was primarily through loessial materials. There are no known faults in formations exposed in the area, nor are there any landslides of significant size known to exist in the area around the reservoir.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=321
dam_267,Reservoir A Dam,"Reservoir A is an offstream reservoir about 7 miles southeast of Lewiston, Idaho, that has a total capacity of 3,000 acre-feet (active 3,000 acre-feet). Safety of Dams work was completed at Reservoir A in 1999. A stability berm with drainage features was constructed along the downstream toe of the lower embankment, the upstream face of the lower embankment was reworked, and minor modifications were made on the upstream face of the upper embankment and to the outlet portal. In addition, the reservoir operating elevation was restricted to 1800 feet reducing the reservoir’s total capacity from 3,000 acre-feet to 1,960 acre-feet. This work was accomplished under the Bureau of Reclamation’s Safety of Dams Program. An Issue Evaluation was completed in 2009, which indicated that the reservoir restriction could be eased to allow storage to elevation 1804.0 ft, 2,440 acre-feet. Geology Topography probably was the major factor influencing the selection of the site for Reservoir A Dam.The reservoir basin is a shallow, round-bottomed, erosional valley eroded into a gently undulating lava plateau by Lindsay Creek. Most of the surface of the plateau is covered with a clayey, silty soil, which is as much as 65 feet thick.The soil is thinnest in drainages where part of the soil cover has been removed by erosion.A few small outcrops of basalt are present on the plateau surface surrounding the reservoir basin and in some of the deeper drainages in the area. Clayey, silty soil with some fine sand constitutes most of the foundation and abutments of Reservoir A Dam. The soil was derived from weathering of basalt. It shows no evidence of stratification and is interpreted as a residual deposit. Near the right abutment of the dam, thick layers of silty clay, lime clay, silty sand and thin alternating layers of sandstone, clay, sand and boulders were penetrated by drilling. Stratification indicates this material has been transported and is interpreted as an alluvial deposit.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=267

dam_198,Rifle Gap Dam,"Rifle Gap Dam is about 5 1/2 miles north of Rifle, at a point where Rifle Creek cuts through the Grand Hogback. The dam is an earthfill structure with a spillway. Rifle Gap Reservoir has a total capacity of 13,602 acre-feet and an active capacity of 12,168 acre-feet, and when full, a surface area of 359 acres. Geology Rifle Gap Dam is located at the head of a narrow canyon eroded through the Grand Hogback by Rifle Gap. The hogback stands in relief above the adjacent topography because it is formed by Mesaverde sandstone and shale which are most resistant to erosion than formations an either side. Mancos shale outcrops north of the hogbacks and forms a strike valley. The soft Wasatch and Ohio Creek formations are found to the south and form valleys and badlands topography. Prior to construction West Rifle Creek and East Rifle Creek merged to form Rifle Creek at a point approximately 400 feet downstream from the centerline of the dam. Valley fill in the area is as thick as 120 feet or more. The fill consists of coalescing stream deposits, alluvial fan material, and in the upper portions, variable thickness of glacial outwash fan material. A considerable portion of the slopes above the valley are covered with slope wash. A small northwest-southeast fault was mapped between the upper and lower axes during preliminary exploration. The fault is located about 100 feet south of the downstream toe of the dam. Records indicate that rock on either side of the fault is sheared in the left abutment.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=198

dam_325,San Justo Dam,"San Justo Dam and Reservoir are located near the center of the Coast Ranges Province of California. The province is characterized by north-west-tending valleys and mountain ranges formed along major faults as a result of plate tectonic stresses. The mountain ranges consist of uplifted, pre-Cenozoic 'basement' rock, comprising a series of narrow v-shaped canyons and ridges flanked by rolling foothills. The Diablo Range to the east is underlain by two different rock units, the Franciscan Assemblage and the Great valley Sequence. To the west, the Gabilan Range is underlain by the granitic Sur Series where ""basement"" rock is partially blanketed by Cenozoic sedimentary rock. East and south of Hollister, the Diablo Range and the Gabilan Range are capped by Mesozoic volanic flows. The valleys are filled with Cenozoic marine and nonmarine sediments. In the valleys east of the San Andreas Rift Zone, Pliocene lakebed sediments are common below elevation 122 meters. The reservoir and damsite are located wirthin the eastern foothills of the Gabilan Range.

dam_225,Scoggins Dam,"Scoggins Dam is a 151-foot-high zoned earthfill structure that is 2,700 feet long at the crest and contains 4 million cubic yards of material. The upstream side of the dam is faced with rock riprap for protection against wave action; the downstream side is faced with topsoil and planted with grass. Total capacity of Henry Hagg Lake is 59,910 acre-feet (active 53,600 acre-feet). As part of the operation and maintenance modification activities, a drain was installed on the left abutment in 1987. Regional Geology Scoggins Dam and Reservoir are situated in the foothill on the eastern slope of the north-trending coast ranges of northwestern Oregon. This portion of the eastern flank of the coast ranges is a northeast-dipping monocline consisting of marine volcanic and sedimentary formations of Tertiary age. Near the eastern limit of the foothills (east of the damsite), these units are unconformably overlain by the Columbia River Basalt of Miocene age. The basalt is in turn unconformably overlain by various nonmarine sedimentary units of Pliocene and Pleistocene age (Schlicker and Deacon, 1967; fig. EG-1). This region is broken by a series of northwest trending faults having displacements of several hundred to more than a thousand feet (Schlicker and Deacon, 1967). All major valleys, including Scoggins Creek on which the dam is situated, are underlain by unconsolidated stream alluvium of recent (Holocene) age. Stratigraphy. - The regional geologic units are described in detail below in order of decreasing age:  (1) Eocene volcanics and sediments undifferentiated - This unit is a sequence of structurally complex basalt flows, pillow lava, tuff, agglomerate, and breccia with well-indurated marine siltstone and sandstone interbeds. The sequence dips east and northeast and is several thousand feet thick in the Scoggins Creek area, thickening westward in the coast ranges. Only the extreme northwest portion of the reservoir is underlain by this unit. It is overlain, presumably conformably, by the Yamhill Formation. (3) Spencer Formation - The Spencer Formation is exposed in a nearly continuous, 17-mile belt that commences just east of Carlton and trends northwesterly nearly to Gales Peak, a few miles north of Scoggins Creek. The formation is more than a mile wide east of Carlton and narrows to about a quarter of a mile where it crosses the Tualatin River and Scoggins Creek. The formation consists of thick-bedded to massive, well-sorted, friable, fine- to medium grained feldspathic sandstone with occasional thin carbonaceous siltstone and claystone interbeds. In the top and bottom portions of the formation, thin-bedded siltstone and claystone predominate. The sandstone is typically composed of about 40 percent quartz, 55 percent plagioclase feldspar, and 5 percent muscovite, biotite, and chlorite. In the northwest, two-thirds of its outcrop belt, where it averages 200 feet in thickness, the formation is composed almost entirely of friable, fine sandstone. This unit is less susceptible to landsliding than the other Tertiary marine units in the area. The Spencer Formation is upper Eocene in age and is overlain by Oligocene marine sediments. (2) Yamhill Formation - The Yamhill Formation consists primarily of well-indurated, thin-bedded shale and siltstone with occasional interbeds of green basaltic sandstone and poorly sorted tuffaceous sandstone (photo EG-1). Locally, basalt and gabbro dikes and sills have invaded the formation. The Yamhill Formation underlies most of the Yamhill River Valley and trends northerly in a thinning outcrop belt to within a short distance north of Scoggins Creek. It is also present in isolated exposures in the bed of Gales Creek. Its thickness ranges from probably less than 1,000 feet in the Scoggins Creek area to more than 2,000 feet in the Yamhill River Valley. Its primary structure is monoclinal eastward with local irregularities. This unit weathers deeply and, because of its fine-grained nature, is very susceptible to landsliding on relatively shallow slopes (Tengesdal, 1968). The Yamhill Formation is lower upper Eocene in age and is unconformably overlain by the Spencer Formation. (4) Oligocene marine sediments undifferentiated - The uppermost rocks of the Oligocene sequence are composed of tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone. Beneath this sequence, in most areas, is a section of moderately indurated quartzitic sandstone' The lower part of the Oligocene section generally consists of siltstone, basaltic sandstone, and local conglomerate. In the Scoggins Creek Quarry, basaltic sandstone and conglomerate occur below a well-indurated, limey sandstone which contains abundant megafossils in several 1-foot layers. The total maximum thickness of the undifferentiated Oligocene sequence is estimated to be about 3,000 feet, although its thickness varies considerably in the map area. On the basis of faunal data, the lower Oligocene section is estimated to be about 1,000 feet and the upper Oligocene about 2,000 feet thick. The Oligocene sequence generally dips to the east and northeast at low to moderate angles. Locally, fault beds dip 40 to 500. In a few areas, dips are reversed to the south and southwest to form local anticlines. This sequence is overlain unconformably by the Columbia River Basalt.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=225

dam_235,Shadow Mountain Dam,"Shadow Mountain Dam is located approximately .8 miles upstream from the alpine glacial limit. The terminal moraine is located to the south of Grand Lake and is mapped as glacial drift. The dam is located in an area where recurrent glaciers mover various distances down the valleys and left a mantle on morainal materials over the older formations. Occasional ridges of glacial debris were deposited across the valleys as end moraines when the ice receded. Shadow Mountain Dam is located in one of these moraines. The upper foundation materials are described as undifferentiated glacial moraine deposits. The heterogeneous mixture of sand, gravel, cobbles and bounders with minor amounts of silt and clay are 28 to 38 feet thick. A 13 to 17 foot thick layer of silt with sand and sandy silt, described as alluvium, lies below the undifferentiated deposits.

Shasta Reservoir is fed by the Sacramento, Pit, and McCloud rivers, with additional water coming from Squaw Creek. This drainage area receives an average of 62 inches of annual precipitation, which in pre-dam years was a major contributor to frequent floods in the valley below. With the construction of Shasta Dam, the river flows have been regulated and water stored. Water is used for irrigation, municipal and industrial needs, salinity control for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and to meet environmental needs. Water released to the river is sent through the Shasta Powerplant, which produces hydroelectric power for the 15-state western power grid.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=241
dam_245,Silver Jack Dam,"Silver Jack Dam is located on Cimarron Creek about 20 miles above the junction with the Gunnison River. The rolled-earthfill dam contains 1,278,140 cubic yards of material and has a structural height of 173 feet. Its crest is 1,050 feet long and 30 feet wide. The outlet works to Cimarron Creek in the right abutment has a capacity of 280 cubic feet per second with the reservoir at the normal water surface elevation of 8926.0 feet and a capacity of 160 cubic feet per second at the minimum water surface elevation of 8840.0 feet. The spillway on the right abutment is an uncontrolled ogee section with a capacity of 6,220 cubic feet per second at maximum water surface elevation. The reservoir has a total capacity of 13,520 acre-feet, including 12,820 acre-feet of active capacity and 700 acre-feet of inactive capacity. When filled to its normal water surface elevation, the reservoir has a surface area of 293 acres. Geology Silver Jack Dam is constructed on glacial till (Qwt) and alluvial stream deposits (Qal). Approximately 20 feet of pervious alluvial gravel overlies at least 80 feet of relatively impervious glacial till. The alluvial deposits blanket the valley bottom along Cimmaron Creek from approximate station 6+10 to 10+50. The pervious alluvial gravel deposits were excavated from the cutoff trench, which is located roughly 150 feet upstream of the dam centerline and approximately 100 feet wide. Alluvial gravel deposits remain beneath the dam upstream and downstream of the cutoff trench. The alluvial material is crudely stratified and predominantly clean to silty, sandy gravel and was logged in the wells of the cutoff trench as ""sandy gravel, cobbles and boulders"". These alluvial deposits also contain occasional thin layers of organic materials. Laboratory analysis of a 30-pound sample of alluvium from the cutoff trench indicated .5 percent nonplastic fines, 22 percent sand, 74 percent gravel and 3.5 percent cobbles. Isolated, small pockets or lenses of sand were noted on the maps of the cutoff trench walls in the alluvium. The contact between alluvium and the glacial till was also mapped in the cutoff trench. The underlying glacial till deposit consists predominantly of widely varying amounts of silt, gravel, cobbles and boulders and was described in the cutoff trench as ""clayey to silty gravel and cobbles with blocks of shale and agglomerate"". Laboratory analyses of glacial till material from the cutoff trench indicate 20 percent fines (liquid limit 36, plasticity index 10), 43 percent sand and 37 percent gravel.

The dam is a concrete thin-arch structure, 207 feet high, with gravity abutments. When built by the Salt River Valley Water Users' Association from 1928-1930, the dam included an open, super-elevated channel spillway equipped with radial gates. The spillway was modified by Reclamation in 1936. The work consisted of building a concrete-lined spillway discharge channel, 450 feet long by 265 feet wide, below the existing ogee spillway; reconditioning the hoisting equipment for the radial gates; and installing individual gate operating motors and two 10-kilovolt-ampere gasoline-engine driven generators. From 1988 to 1992, the dam was again modified by Reclamation, to meet concerns about its stability in a probable maximum flood or maximum credible earthquake. To address PMF concerns, a new spillway was constructed on the dam`s right abutment to increase its ability to safely release flood waters. As part of earthquake protection measures, a new concrete overlay was placed over areas on the right and left abutments to improve the dam`s stability. The existing power penstock and river outlet works were also replaced, the road on the top of the dam was raised and widened, and the existing left spillway and spillway wall was modified. In addition, drainage holes were drilled at selected locations in the dam`s foundation to help relieve hydraulic uplift pressures, and some areas of the foundation were grouted to help reduce seepage.

The dam is a zoned earthfill structure 164 feet high with a volume of 2,250,000 cubic yards. It is approximately 3,00 feet long, averages 30 feet wide at the crest, and is 164 feet high at the maximum section. The outlet works consist of a combination pressure tunnel and a 10-foot diameter penstock upstream of the gates and two penstocks, 5.5 feet in diameter, downstream. Releases are controlled by two 48-inch diameter jet flow valves, with a capacity up to 1,740 cubic feet per second at the top of the flood control pool. Irrigation releases, up to 100 cubic feet per second, may be made through a 20-inch jet flow valve. Larger releases are made through a service spillway near the west end of the dam. This service spillway is a tainter-gated chute-type structure with three 45-foot openings and an invert elevation at 4,259 feet mean sea level. An emergency spillway in the left abutment consists of a fuse plug type embankment. A 500-foot concrete sill, with a crest elevation of 4,275 feet mean sea level, is covered with earth and rock fill, and forms four individual sections at elevations 4,282, 4,283, 4,284, and 4,285 feet mean sea level. These sections are 130 feet, 130 feet, 118 feet, and 118 feet respectively. The reservoir has an estimated active conservation capacity of 43,768 acre-feet in 1999. In addition to storage for irrigation, the dam and reservoir provide flood control and recreation benefits. While there is no storage allocated to recreation, there is a minimum pool of 2,500 acre feet. In 1980, a transfer of irrigation storage rights to Santa Rosa Dam (a Corps of Engineers' dam), and Reservoir in Northern New Mexico provided for more flood control storage in Lake Sumner (under direction of the Corps of Engineers).",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=226

dam_236,Taylor Park Dam,"Taylor Park Dam is on the Taylor River, a tributary of the Gunnison River. The dam is a zoned earthfill structure 206 feet high, with a crest length of 675 feet and a volume of 1,115,000 cubic yards. It creates a reservoir with a storage capacity of 106,200 acre-feet. The spillway is an overflow-type weir crest 180 feet long with a capacity of 10,000 cubic feet per second. The outlet works is a horseshoe tunnel with a diameter of 10 feet, and a capacity of 1,500 cubic feet per second. Geology The Taylor Park damsite is on the western flank of the Sawatch Mountains. It is characterized by complexly folded and faulted Precambrian rocks unconformably overlain by Paleozoic sediments. During the Laramide Orogeny, the area was subjected to uplift, folding, and thrust faulting. Renewed movement, probably during the Miocene period, dissected the area with a series of highangle normal faults. The last major process to affect the area was glaciation which modified the preexisting erosional valleys by additionally carving or filling them with debris. The dam is founded on highly jointed bedrock, alluvial deposits, and some talus cone material. The left abutment is composed of Precambrian metamorphic rock, predominantly phyllites or finegrained schists with nearly vertical structural attitude. The right abutment is founded in Paleozoic folded sedimentary rocks composed of sandstone, overlain by quartzites and dolomitic limestone. The contact between the two formations occurs at the base of the right abutment as a fault zone. The fault zone, investigated by borings, test excavations and tunnels, consisted of a crushed zone several feet wide, with material altered to a soft gouge due to weathering. Much of this material was removed during construction activities. Several small secondary faults with minor crushed zones were also uncovered during the foundation excavation.The alluvial materials are found above the phyllite, under the downstream embankment shell, from about 75 feet downstream of centerline to the downstream toe. Material is predominately well graded to poorly graded gravel with varying amounts of silt, sand and cobbles. In this area, the foundation was not stripped to bedrock.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=236

dam_242,Theodore Roosevelt Dam,"Theodore Roosevelt Dam, the first major structure constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation on the Salt River Project, is located about 76 miles northeast of Phoenix and 30 miles northwest of Globe, Arizona. The dam, completed in 1911, was subsequently modified between 1989 and 1996. The original dam was a cyclopean, rubble-masonry, thick-arch structure that spanned the Salt River to form a reservoir of 1,381,580 acre-feet. It was 280 feet high, 723 feet long at the crest, and contained 355,800 cubic yards of masonry, In 1936, the spillways were modified by lowering crests 6 feet to increase their capacities, and installing individual gate hoists, operating motors, and two 5-kilovolt-ampere gasoline-engine driven generators. From 1989 to 1996, the dam was modified by the Bureau of Reclamation. The modification raised the dam 77 feet in elevation and made the dam a concrete-gravity arch dam, increasing its water conservation storage capacity by 20 percent, adding flood control space to the reservoir, and addressing concerns about its safety as well as the safety downstream dams. In addition to raising the dam's height, the modification included construction of two new spillways, installation of new outlet works, and powerplant modifications. Also, existing recreation facilities at Roosevelt Lake were improved, and new recreational facilities were constructed.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=242
dam_300,Thief Valley Dam,"Thief Valley Dam is a reinforced concrete, slab and buttress (Ambursen) structure, 73 feet high and 390 feet long. The original reported (1932) total capacity of Thief Valley Reservoir was 17,600 acre-feet (active 17,400 acre-feet) and covered an area of 740 acres. A sedimentation survey completed in 1992 estimated the total capacity at13,307 acre-feet (active 13,300 acre-feet) and the surface area at 685 acres. Geology Thief Valley Dam is founded on closely fractured, metamorphosed basaltic rock. The basalt is hard, brittle and only slightly altered. Principal orthogonal fractures are spaced 12 to 18 inches apart and are oriented parallel and perpendicular to the canyon axis. Subsidiary jointing is spaced less than 2 inches apart and oriented obliquely to the principal joint-set. There appears to be no change in fracture orientation between the right and left abutments inferring that there are no faults of significance within the canyon.Two shear zones are visible in the rock of the right abutment. These zones are about one foot wide, the width varying in both directions. A third shear zone was reported to pass between No.6 and No. 9 buttresses within the stilling basin area. The shear zone material, which consisted of alterered rock, was excavated to a depth of about 6-feet below sound rock and to a sufficient width to allow for the placement of a 6-foot concrete footing where buttress 7 crosses. A cutoff trench was excavated on the upstream toe of the dam, and curtain grouting was performed along the trench through grout holes which were drilled on about 5-foot centers and to a depth of about 10 to 20 feet.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=300

dam_252,Tiber Dam,"Tiber Dam is a zoned earthfill structure located on the Marias River, approximately 20 miles southwest of Chester, Montana. The dam has a crest width of 30 feet, a crest length of 4,300 feet, and structural height of 211 feet. The upstream face is protected by a 3-foot layer of riprap and is sloped at 3:1. a zone of previous material consisting of selected sand, gravel and cobbles, covers the downstream face. A 1977 Safety of Dams modification raised the dam crest 5 feet to an elevation of 3,026.00 feet above sea-level. Total reservoir storage capacity is 1,555,898 acre-feet at an elevation of 3,020.20 feet. An earthfill dike occupies a saddle on the south rim of the reservoir near the dam embankment. This dike has a crest width of 25 feet, a crest length of 17,000 feet, and a maximum structural height of 60 feet. The upstream face is protected by a 3-toot layer of riprap, while the downstream face is grass covered and has an intermediate 10-foot-wide-berm. Tiber Dam was originally constructed from 1951 to 1956. Because of excessive spillway settlement, the spillway was diked off and an auxiliary outlet works was constructed from 1967 to 1969. To restore the original operational functions, a construction contract for rehabilitating the spillway was issued in 1976 for completion in 1979, followed by a second contract for raising the dam and dike 5 feet during a construction period between 1979 and 1981. Both abutments of Tiber Dam are located in the Telegraph Creek Formation that is composed of gypsiferous, poorly cemented sandstone and firm shale. Both formations are of Upper Cretaceous Age. Glacial till, loess and terrace deposits of Holocene Age can be found on top of the Marias River Valley Walls covering sandstone or shale deposits.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=252
dam_253,Tieton Dam,"Tieton Dam, on the Tieton River about 40 miles west of Yakima, is an earthfill structure with a concrete core wall that extends from the crest to about 100 feet below the riverbed. The dam is 319 feet high and contains 2,049,000 cubic yards of material. The reservoir’s active capacity is 198,000 acre-feet. Geology The geologic structure of the basin has a base of shale and sandstone sediments which were subsequently overlain by the basalt flows of the Columbia River lava. As the Cascade Mountains uplifted, stream erosion cut deep canyons through the basalt and underlying rock. Subsequent to the uplift, lava flows completely covered the upper ends of the stream valleys and partly filled sections of the stream with andesite. The andesite in the canyons was later eroded away leaving the upper end of the valley still deeply buried.

This is a stable, impervious and satisfactory foundation",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=188
dam_266,Trinity Dam,"Trinity Dam Trinity Dam is located in the southeastern Klamath Mountains physiographic province of northern California. Historically, the area has been characterized by low-level seismic activity. Nevertheless, the dam may be subjected to low to moderate levels of ground shaking from nearby or distant earthquakes, particularly those that might originate in adjacent, more seismically active provinces, such as the Coast Ranges, Cascade Range, Great Valley, or Modoc Plateau. The most notable early work in the area of Trinity Dam is that of J. S. Diller (1906), who mapped the Redding 30-minute quadrangle, as well as other quadrangles in the Klamath Mountains. A more current review of the general geology of the Klamath Mountains province is Irwin (1966). Large-scale geologic mapping of the area surrounding Trinity Dam and Clair Engle Lake was done by Lydon and Klein (1969), Albers and others (1964), and Irwin (1963). Detailed discussions of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the Klamath Mountains are provided by Irwin (1981) and Burchfiel and Davis (1981). The regional geology of Trinity Dam and Clair Engle Lake is depicted on the Redding and Weed sheets of the Geologic Map of California (Strand, 1962, 1963). The Quaternary geology of the Trinity Dam area is not well understood, at least in part because of a general lack of studies of the Quaternary geologic history of the area. A notable exception is the study of Quaternary glacial deposits in the Trinity Alps, northwest of Trinity Dam, by Sharp (1960). A brief discussion of Quaternary terrace deposits near Trinity Dam is included in Lydon and Klein (1969). Site-specific studies of Quaternary faulting in the Klamath Mountains are also lacking. The nearest detailed studies of Quaternary faulting to Trinity Dam are those of Helley and others (1981) and Harlan Miller Tait Associates (1983) on the Battle Creek fault, 55 km south of Trinity Dam (enclosure 1). Regional fault maps show a general absence of Quaternary faults in the general vicinity of Trinity Dam (Jennings, 1975; Howard and others, 1978) with the exception of the Battle Creek fault. Similarly, there appear to be very few historical earthquakes in the area of the dam, especially as compared with adjacent geologic provinces to the east and west (Real and others, 1978; Toppozada and others, 1981). The state of crustal stress in the Klamath Mountains is poorly defined, due to the near absence of recorded seismicity prior to 1983, when the USBR monitoring effort began (Zoback and Zoback, 1980; USBR, 1984a). Zoback and Zoback place the southeastern Klamath Mountains in the Sierra Nevada stress province, which is characterized by a combination of strike-slip and normal faulting. However, most major faults in the Klamath Mountains appear to be reverse faults (Irwin, 1981).The site geology of Trinity Dam is described by Lydon and Klein (1969) and is also summarized in the March 26, 1980 SEED Examination Report. The brief synopsis below is based on these sources and on data provided by Irwin (1966, 1981), Strand (1962, 1963), and Albers and others (1964). Trinity Dam is located on the eastern Klamath plate, the oldest and easternmost of four eastward-dipping thrust sheets that comprise the Klamath Mountains province. Rocks of the eastern Klamath plate are Devonian to Jurassic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks that are underlain by widespread sheets of ultramafic rocks, and have been intruded by Jurassic to Cretaceous granitic stocks and batholiths. Trinity Dam is founded on the uppermost part of the Copley Greenstone, a mildly metamorphosed volcanic formation of probable Devonian age. Most of the reservoir area is underlain by the Mississippian Bragdon Formation, a slatey argillite of marine origin. Other units of relatively minor extent include Paleozoic ultramafic rocks, Mesozoic granitic intrusive rocks, Oligocene nonmarine sedimentary rocks of the Weaverville Formation and Quaternary alluvial and glacial deposits. The Copley Greenstone is quite competent where it is fresh, but there was originally a thick weathered zone formed on the rocks in the abutments. This zone was thickest near several fault zones encountered during construction. Available information contained in the SEED Examination Report, dated March 26, 1980, indicates that potentially unstable material in the abutments was removed or adequately treated prior to placement of the embankment. The remaining weathered and unconsolidated materials in the abutments consist of residual soil and weathered bedrock that appear to be stable and well-drained, according to the March 26, 1980 SEED Examination Report. Construction geology records also indicate that unconsolidated alluvial deposits in the channel section were completely removed down to fresh rock before fill placement. The Bragdon Formation is relatively weak and unstable, especially on steep slopes where bedding is roughly parallel to the slope. Several landslides exist where these conditions are present, most notably on the downstream left abutment, above the spillway chute. Further assessment of the potential for earthquake-induced failure of this and other unstable masses around the reservoir is needed. Several faults were mapped in the Paleozoic rocks in the foundation of Trinity Dam during construction (Lydon and Klein, 1969). All of these faults appear to be long inactive, and displacements have been relatively minor. The March 26, 1980 SEED Examination Report states that one fault in the left abutment was overlain by 12 to 18 m of weathered rock, which is suggestive of a considerable amount of time since the fault was last active, perhaps on the order of millions of years.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=266

dam_193,Twitchell Dam,"Twitchell Reservoir is a reservoir in southern San Luis Obispo County, California. The reservoir has a capacity of 224,300 acre feet and is formed by Twitchell Dam on the Cuyama River about 66 miles from its headwaters in the Chumash Wilderness Area and about 6miles from its confluence with the Sisquoc River, where they form the Santa Maria River. Twitchell dam was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1956 and 1958. The original names were Vacquero Dam and Vacquero Reservoir, but they were changed to honor T. A. Twitchell of Santa Maria, a proponent of the project. The dam and reservoir provide flood control and water conservation. The Central Coast of California only receives significant amounts of rainfall during the winter, this area averaging 14inches per year. The water is stored in the reservoir during big winter storms and released as quickly as possible while still allowing it to percolate into the soil and recharge the groundwater. This means that the reservoir is usually far from full. It is estimated that the project increases reacharge by 20,000 acre feet per year. Sedimentation is a problem for the reservoir, as the reservoir is being filled faster than expected. This reduces its capacity and blocks the water inlet to the control gates. Some sediment has been removed by flushing it out during releases, but much of it is simply deposited immediately downstream, interfering with flows. There is no public access to the dam or reservoir.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=193

Vega Reservoir has a surface area of about 900 acres, with a capacity of 33,800 acre-feet, and a shoreline of approximately 7 miles. Geology Collbran Project is located along the northeastern slope of Grand Mesa. The mesa is composed of horizontally bedded, tertiary rocks belonging to the Wasatch and Green River formations and capped by lave flow of Quaternary basalt. During Pleistocene times, sheet-like glaciers covered the mesa. Glacial scouring produced the many small mesa lakes and the heterogeneous deposits of glacial debris, which mantle a large part of the surface rock. These glacial deposits cover the lava in varying depths from one hundred to several hundred feet. The Vega Damsite is in an erosional narrows cut across the toe of a large fan. Overburden debris covers bedrock at the damsite to a depth of 135 feet, becoming progressively deeper to the south. The fan is composed of clayey silt containing basalt boulders.

dam_86,Wasco Dam,"Wasco Dam is a 59-foot-high zoned earthfill structure that contains 57,000 cubic yards of material. The crest is 20 feet wide and 415 feet long. The reservoir behind the dam has a total capacity of 13,100 acre-feet (active 11,900 acre-feet) and a surface area of 557 acres. The outlet works consists of 20-foot-wide approach and outlet channels, a submerged vertical intake structure, a single rectangular 4- by 5-foot conduit, a gate chamber with two 3-foot-square slide gates and two overflow weirs, and a 56-foot-long stilling basin. The slide gates are operated manually by two lifts on top of the gate chamber structure at the crest of the dam. The emergency spillway, crossing the left abutment, consists of an unlined channel with a base width of 30 feet. A concrete overflow grade wall is in the spillway 10 feet upstream of the axis of the dam. In October 1997, a restriction limiting reservoir operation to elevation 3505.0 feet was imposed due to seepage on the face of the dam which occurs above this elevation. This 9-foot restriction reduces the available reservoir capacity to 7,000 acre-feet. Geology Wasco Dam is in a narrow valley with steep slide slopes. The left abutment juts out into the valley and at a height of 50 feet above the stream flattens off into a bench. Ice or glacial deposits, causing ice or glacial melt water to discharge once blocked the stream channel over a bench a few hundred feet behind the left abutment. A channel developed which extends from this rock bench to a point in the present channel a few hundred feet downstream from the dam site. Bedrock at the lowest point of the old channel is about 15 feet above the reservoir flow line. Overburden at the flow line on the right abutment consisted of 28 feet of gravel with excess sand and silt. Boulders were hard, fresh andesite 2 to 3 feet in diameter. Much of the over burden between flow line and the valley flow was undoubtedly quite permeable.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=86
dam_281,Webster Dam,"The Webster Dam and Reservoir is located within the High Plains Province of Kansas. The geologic conditions involved are relatively simple, as all subsurface beds are nearly horizontal. No major faults or faulting is known in the area. Some movement has occurred within the Niobrara and Carlisle formations, with joints and small faults being the existing evidence. Moisture moving along the faults created planes of weakness where sliding could occur. All deposits are of a sedimentary, no igneous or metamorphic rocks are exposed or close to the surface in the Webster area. Unconsolidated Pleistocene deposits mantle the older consolidated sediments except for a few erosional hills and bluffs formed by the more resistant Fort Hays limestone. The deposits involved in the construction of Webster Dam ranged in age from Cretaceous (Carlisle shale) to Recent (river Alluvium). Tertiary deposits are not found at the damsite but do occur adjacent to the upper reaches of the reservoir. The Carlisle shale is the bedrock underlying the river alluvium; the Fort Hays or Smoky Hill members of the Niobrara formation underlie the uplands. The Carlisle shale is a marine of upper Cretaceous age and Gulfian Series and has an average thickness of 300 feet. The Niobrara formation, Upper Cretaceous age, conformable overlays the Carlisle shale. It is composed of two easily distinguished members. The Fort Hays, the lower member, is composed of several massive chalky limestone beds separated by thin shale or bentonite layers.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=281

dam_90,Whiskeytown Dam,"Whiskeytown Dam is located in the Clear Creek drainage basin within the extreme southeastern foothills of the Klamath Mountains physiographic province. The dam is about 3.5 miles westward from the Sacramento Valley. The drainage basin is bordered on the east by the low foothill Mule Mountain range at an elevation of 2,300 feet, beyond which lies the northern part of the Sacramento Valley. South and west of the area, the high peak and range of Shasta Valley rises to elevation 6,209 and spreads north to become contiguous with the Trinity Mountains which form the divide between Trinity River and Clear Creek Basins. A simplified geologic column representative of the Whiskeytown Dam project area is given below. All the rock formations have been metamorphosed to varying degrees of intensity. Dynamic and thermal forces have physically and chemically altered the original rock.The Balaklala metarhyolite and the Mule Mountain albite granite stock form the damsitz foundation and the eastern side of the reservoir. This granite is complexly intrusive into the rhyolite and is everywhere faulted along this contact.Scattered patches of terrace gravel and small deposits of recent alluvium occur in the reservoir and tributary streams. Extensive deposits of terrace gravel and of recent alluvium occur in the French Gulch area several miles upstream from the reservoir. At the dam, Clear Creek flows through a narrow, sharply incised canyon which traverses a strongly dissected, hilly upland with local relief of approximately 300 feet. The more subdued topography upstream from the dam suggests that the ancestral stream flowed in a broader valley through the reservoir area.Two geologic formations underlie the dam. To the east, providing the foundation for the main dam, is a sequence of rhyolitic lava flows which have been metamorphosed and tilted steeply eastward. These flows are part of the Balaklala Metarhyolite Formation. The foundation for the two dikes across the saddles at the right (west) end of the dam is composed chiefly of intrusive granite which is part of the Mule Mountain stock. The contact between the metarhyolite and the granite trends roughly parallel to Clear Creek and crosses the dam axis at station 22+00. Both the metarhyolite and the granite are cut by dikes of metadiorite at several places.The foundation of the main dam consists wholly of metarhyolite porphyry and associated dikes. The unweathered rock is hard but brittle. Throughout the dam area, this rock has a distinctive platyness or foliation consisting of subparallel irregular parting surfaces spaced 0.25 to I inch apart and apparently parallel to the original flow banding. The weathered rock has a bleached to soft, chalky appearance; it is iron stained along the fractures and has a definite looseness along the foliation.The granite forming the foundation of the two dikes is medium to coarse grained and variably altered in character. Although the rock is hard when fresh, it is generally brittle due both to its siliceous composition and an incipient foliation or internal shearing. This rock commonly has a splintery fracture. The weathered granite is appreciably soft and has a widespread development of clay minerals and iron oxide. A thick 15- to 52-foot mantle of buff, siltygravelly sand (SM) (decomposed granite) covered the sound granite in the vicinity of the dikes.At several places in the dam foundation, the granite and the metarhyolite have been intruded by dikes of metadiorite, the largest of which is about 20 feet wide and at least 1,500 feet long. At several of these dikes the rock is deeply weathered to a thick mantle of reddish-brown clayey residual soil. The fresh rock is hard.The most distinctive and readily apparent geologic structure in the dam foundation is the foliation or platyness exhibited by the metarhyolite. This platyness generally strikes N. 10 degrees to 20 degrees W. and dips 65 degrees to 75 degrees eastward. It occurs uniformly throughout the metarhyolite as wavy partings spaced 0.25 to I.0 inch apart, causing the rock to break into slabby or lenticular fragments. The rock tends to split readily along the foliation and thus allow downward percolating water to weather, soften, and iron stain the rock.A steeply dipping, incipient foliation or shearing trend occurs in the granite. Shearing of variable intensity is present throughout the area. The splintery break and the numerous wavy slip surfaces have weakened the rock sufficiently in places to cause overbreak during excavation.Faulting is widespread and complex in the metarhyolite and granite. A wide zone of faulting accompanies the metarhyolite-granite contact, with segments of rhyolite displaying considerable drag. In the metarhyolite under the main dam, more than 175 faults were mapped. Zones of clayey gouge and fault breccia ranged in width from a fraction of an inch to more than 1.5 feet. Offsets along the faults generally are small, but a displacement of many feet was found at some of the intrusive dikes.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=90
dam_91,Wickiup Dam,"Wickiup Dam, with a total capacity of 200,000 acre-feet (active 200,000 acre-feet), completed in 1949, stores water for the irrigation of lands in the North Unit Irrigation District. The dam is a zoned earthfill structure, 100 feet high, with a crest length of 13,860 feet. The dam and dike contain 1,852,000 cubic yards of material. The East Dike closes a low area on the east side of the reservoir, and has a crest length of 3,420 feet. The spillway is an open rock cut with concrete sill at the north end of the East Dike. Geology Wickiup Dam and Reservoir are situated in forest covered volcanic mountains, consisting of buttes, craters and intervening sediment covered basins. The intermittent out-pouring of lava flows and explosive volcanic activity has created very complex geologic situations in local areas. The porous lava flows, breccia, ash and deposits of water lain sediment can be linked to a huge absorptive sponge with local perched or depressed water tables, where lakes and springs have been created at various elevations, according to the rate of inflow or outflow of water as it adjusts to local topographic and geologic conditions. The readjustments of the earth's crust during and following volcanic activity undoubtedly created huge cracks, fissures and faults through which the surface water can be lost or move to lower subsurface elevations.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=91
dam_98,Willow Creek Co Dam,"Materials within and surrounding the area of Willow Creek Dam and Reservoir include Cretaceous and Paleocene sedimentary rocks, Miocene basalt flows with interlayered mudstone, siltstone and sandstone of the same age, Pleistocene terrace deposits and alluvium and terrace deposits of Holocene age. The dam and appurtenant structures are situated in an area of Miocene basalt flows and interlayered tuffaceous mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. Most of the older sedimentary rocks, as well as younger surficial materials occur within the upper reaches of the reservoir. At the time investigations were conducted, the sedimentary rocks interlayered with Miocene basalt flows were refereed to as the North Platte formation. Since that time there has been a change in nomenclature. The subject sedimentary rocks are now called the Troublesome formation.",https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=98
