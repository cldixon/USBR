Water from the plant is discharged to Keswick Reservoir. Spring Creek Powerplant is a peaking plant. Its power is dedicated first to meeting the requirements of the project facilities. The remaining energy is marketed to various preference customers in northern California. These facilities were built and are operated by Reclamation. Transmission lines were operated by Reclamation until October 1, 1977, when they were transferred to the Western Area Power Administration, Department of Energy.

plant_559,Stampede Powerplant,"Stampede Powerplant is a run-of-the-river plant. The power generated is dedicated first to meeting the requirements of the project facilities. The remaining energy is marketed to various preference customers in northern California. The dam is a zoned earthfill structure with a height of 239 feet, a crest length of 1,511 feet, and an embankment volume of 4.5 million cubic yards. The dam is 40 feet wide at the crest.The reservoir, with a capacity of 226,500 acre-feet, provides flood control, recreation, a new reservoir fishery, and other fishery improvements on the main Truckee River, Little Truckee River, and Boca Reservoir. The powerplant was placed on-line in 1988. The project was designed to improve the regulation of runoff of the Truckee and Carson River systems and provide supplemental irrigation water and drainage for presently irrigated lands, as well as water for municipal and industrial and fishery uses, flood protection, fish and wildlife benefits, and recreation development.","Stampede Powerplant is a run-of-the-river plant.

plant_560,Towaoc Powerplant *,"The Dolores Project was authorized by the Colorado River Basin Act of September 30, 1968 (Public Law 90-537), as a participating project under the Colorado River Storage Project Act of April 11, 1956 (Public Law 84-485). The Dolores Project, located in the Dolores and San Juan River Basins in southwestern Colorado, develops water from the Dolores River for irrigation, municipal and industrial use, recreation, fish and wildlife, and production of hydroelectric power. It also provides flood control and aids economic redevelopment. Powerplants located on McPhee Dam and the Towaoc Canal generate an annual average of 36,578,000 kilowatt-hours, which enters the Colorado River Storage Project power transmission system. The Towaoc Powerplant operates from April to October on the irrigation water supply conveyed through the canal.","The Dolores Project was authorized by the Colorado River Basin Act of September 30, 1968 (Public Law 90-537), as a participating project under the Colorado River Storage Project Act of April 11, 1956 (Public Law 84-485).

plant_564,Upper Molina Powerplant,"In fiscal year 1992, the unit control system was upgraded. Upper Molina Powerplant installed the UPS system, static exciter, SCADA, and Sy/Max 400 PLC. This reconfigured the plant from local operation to remote. Replaced the turbine runner and unit relay protection in FY 2000. Installed flow meter on the turbine in 2000; new generator circuit breaker and battery monitoring system in 2002. Replaced the governor, controls, and protective relaying in 2003-2004. The Congress authorized the Collbran Project July 3, 1952, under Public Law 445, 82nd Congress, 2nd Session. The Collbran Project, in west-central Colorado, developed a major part of the unused water in Plateau Creek and its principal tributaries. Supplemental irrigation service is furnished and electrical energy is generated for use in west-central Colorado. The project also rehabilitated and modified the operation of 15 small privately owned storage reservoirs on the Grand Mesa in the Cottonwood Creek and Big Creek watersheds. These reservoirs provide water for power generation through exchanging storage water on Grand Mesa for irrigation water from Vega Reservoir.","In fiscal year 1992, the unit control system was upgraded.
